  <div class="title"><strong>THINGS JOSH IS<br>OBSESSED WITH</strong></div><br>
      Spider-Man, tennis, baths, Frasier, the Simpsons, NBA, watching Fox News to raise my blood
      pressure, Roger Federer, people who are left handed, the way Roger Federer doesn’t apologize when his ball luckily hits the top of the net and dribbles over to the opponent’s court, poker, beer pong, videos of people playing chess even though I don’t understand how to play, the new pornographers, Doonesbury, Dan Harmon, the sound Homer makes when he’s pleased, my dog and her impressive speed, guitars, actors who casually play the piano really well, deep 3 pointers, the Indiana Jones theme playing whenever Indiana Jones does something particularly Indiana Jones-y, Edgar Wright, challa, brunettes, coffee and cigarettes, coffee and weed, coffee, cigarettes, weed, Stewart Lee, Derren Brown, Christian spirituals just because they’re catchy, hairlines, height, trying to recognize a guest actor in a cartoon, teeth, goldfish crackers, Charlie Brown’s sad squiggly mouth, movies set in high school, movies about closeted gay people, movies where someone breaks out into song even
      though it’s not a musical movies that are aware that they’re movies and eventually disappear up their own assholes, movies where an actor shows up for one scene and steals the whole fucking thing, Rufus Wainwright, writing perfect raps in my head and pretending like i can freestyle, my father explaining something complicated to me, my mother making up songs about our dog, t-shirts that have rings on the collar and sleeves, melted ice cream, jaffa cakes, Federer’s backhand down the line to save match point in the 2008 Wimbledon final, Ray Allen’s three to tie game 6 of the 2013 finals, knowing the answer to a question on University Challenge, Calvin and Hobbes, Quentin Tarantino’s horrible face and voice and personality, Beach Boys harmonies, seeing a new play I know nothing about, cocoa pebbles, the moment in Toy Story 3 when the toys are heading towards the incinerator and Jessie asks Buzz what to do and Buzz just puts out his hand because he has no fucking clue, fresh bagels, Infinite Jest even though I know how that sounds, having immediate
      chemistry with someone I just met, having a great idea while I’m falling asleep, 9/11, constructing a sentence that perfectly represents my thoughts, heavy rain while I’m inside, watching the news with my grandparents at 7 o’clock in the morning, BLTs, a twist so good i don’t care that the rest of the story was a bit shit, reading reviews of shitty looking movies I’ll never see, having one friend in a class full of freaks, writing something quickly to meet a deadline, making strangers laugh, fantasizing about Trump getting punched in the face by Robert Deniro, Harvey Firestein’s voice, gradually falling in love with a TV show, the very beginning of the Oscars where you convince yourself it won’t be long
      and boring, getting a decent amount of likes on an Instagram post I wasn’t so sure about, winning as Megan Man in Super Smash Bros, bad fake movie accents, the movies of Sidney Lumet, waking up happy.
