          <h1>DAY 5, DILLON: SOFIA-LIN' SO FINE!</h1> <br>

We wake up late at Aunt Helen’s house after my first full night of sleep since boarding my flight to London. I’d slept in a sleeping bag on top of a fully-made-bed in a sparse, yet finely decorated room. We groggily gather in the kitchen to do the dishes abandoned exhaustively the night before, and cook a breakfast of garlic and onion omelettes with canned beans, and generous helpings of black coffee.<br><br>

Bodies showered and the car packed, we stand in the quiet county road ready to leave when we notice an elderly neighbor walking down the street towards us. She’s wearing a sack-like smock and her hands are covered in what looks like pottery clay.<br><br>

Before we’re even within earshot she calls out to us in Bulgarian, talking quickly and moving her hands animatedly. We watch her and try not to look like we had just broken into this beautiful house. We smile and nod stupidly.<br><br>

We recognize a few words: American, avogat (lawyer, similar to French or Spanish), and Christo, who is aunt Helen’s lawyer. When she says one of these recognized words we all chime in happily and repeat the word back to her in unison, nodding vigorously. Eventually we think we understand “telefono christov”. We think that sounds like a good idea and Clement pull out his phone but then realizes he doesn’t have service. As he tries to pantomime “no signal” she takes the phone out of his hand and begins to speak into it. She somehow manages to record a five second voice memo by pressing her face against the screen. When it becomes clear a phone call is not going to happen, we give up and slowly back away towards the car. Looking appropriately abashed, yet dignified we wave goodbye and drive away.<br><br>

We drive along sunny country roads that had seemed so sinister in the smothering fog of the night before. They’re now lined with groups of houses not quite qualifying as villages: low brown buildings surrounded by flowering trellises and lush gardens. Dogs sleep in a number of driveways. We stop for gas and pick up two types of biscuits.<br><br>

The drive to Sofia is 90 minutes. Sunflower fields gradually disappear as the hills fill with brutalist apartment buildings and Cyrillic billboards.<br><br>

At this point we’ve been on a journey within a journey dealing with the technology required to make our blog posts. The Blogger website is completely useless on a mobile platform, not allowing us to scroll down the page of written text, so phones and iPads are out. That meant we would need to use Clement’s laptop, but the screen was broken (half of it was black,) and even more pressingly, neither the keyboard nor the mouse pad worked. We picked up an external mouse and keyboard in Belgrade and, despite warnings from a passerby that the keyboard was not worth the 900 Serbian dinar (9 dollars) that we had paid for it, we were optimistic.<br><br>

From the back seat, as Clement sits in the passenger seat draped in wires with a laptop on the dash in front of him, I point out that the keyboard is in Cyrillic. We laugh, still confident. Clement spends 5 minutes clicking in the supposed region of the password box and types in his password, but seeing as the box falls in the dreaded black zone of his laptop, we aren’t sure what the issue is when his laptop fails to unlock. He boots to Guest Mode and discovers that, alas, only half of the keyboard’s keys work. I won’t bore you with all the frustrating iterations, but, suffice to say there are some fists pounded on dashboards, some keys smacked no less hard than they deserved, and some much-needed neck massage given from the back seat.<br><br>

I later sit down for an interview with Clement to learn more.<br><br>

Q: What was going through your mind in that moment?<br>
A: Which moment? There were many moments because many things went wrong in succession. Each problem we attempted to solve revealed another problem.  But I can tell you that during nearly all of these moments, I wanted to smash the computer into tiny pieces.<br>
Q: A lot of people are wondering, does hitting the keyboard harder help?
A: Yeah it helps. In multiple ways.<br><br>

Fast forward 30 minutes, and Clement rigs an impressive set up. An onscreen keyboard is pulled up on the bottom of the screen, and another little window has a picture-in-picture magnifier that shows hovered-over parts of the screen in the black. Left over is about a 3 by 3 inch internet browser through which we are able to edit and upload. We are feeling more than a little proud. Right then, of course, his computer dies. He closes the screen very slowly. We give up for the time being.<br><br>

Sofia begins slowly and swells, it doesn’t appear all of a sudden. We stop on the edge of Sofia to meet Christo’s daughter, Katrin, and return the house keys to her. While Clement finds an ATM to pay her to have the keys mailed back to the US, I buy a round of coffees, and Katrin goes to the post office and brings us each a postcard in which she has written a greeting.<br><br>

We head to a hostel I booked while in the coffee shop. On the way we pass the famous Alexander Nevsky cathedral, other smaller churches with colorful walls and golden domes, and many large Soviet style governmental-looking buildings.<br><br>

Inside the hostel, people are watching the France vs. Uruguay World Cup knockout match, and France scores their second goal as we we are checking in.
We walk to the Alexander Nevsky cathedral and look around, passing kids playing soccer in fenced-in courtyards along the way.<br><br>

The cathedral bubbles out of itself, one dome emerging immediately from the next. They are all topped with soft blue-green copper, except the central dome, which is gold. Arched windows covering its surface make the cathedral appear porous.<br><br>

<div class="caption"> Photos by: Clement Gelly </div><br><br>


The cathedral’s closed, so we peruse the stalls of the street vendors selling antique trinkets and jewelry. I buy a silver chain to replace the gaudy gold one I currently have on, and attach the Saint Christopher pendant that James Gelly had given to each of us.<br><br>

We continue on to a restaurant that Katrin recommends to us, Moma. Our route brings us to a large promenade thronged with people, shops and restaurants lining the sides -  every restaurant fronted by a large seated patio.<br><br>

The restaurant has a short wait, so we walk to the bottom the promenade towards a large sculpture. The sculpture rests on a long, curved, stem headed by a ball of layered metal from which hundreds of skinny metal rods topped by small blue balls protrude. Around the whole head are purple-ish bands. We debate whether it looks like an atom or a dandelion. It is obviously a dandelion, but the atom interpretation is more provocative.<br><br>

We sit at a cafe and drink a large glass of beer as we people watch, and listen to a street violinist. The temperature is perfect, and the scene is exquisitely peaceful and satisfying.<br><br>

Moma flirts with the upper-end of our price range, but we decide to indulge. We sit in the walled courtyard and stuff ourselves with sheep cheese, goat cheese, cow cheese, and buffalo cheese. We drink red wine with our group plate of multiple types of sausages, lamb patties, chicken, and bacon-wrapped pork. We finish with halva and espresso, and leaned back - fatigued.<br><br>

I read from my phone descriptions of bars and clubs that we should go to and we apathetically decide on a few to check out, committed to exploring the night life so we can report back to Nick’s sister, Mari, who is Bulgarian.<br><br>

It’s nearly 11:00 PM when we leave the restaurant, and it’s finally dark. We head towards the hostel but stopp to buy beer, and buy two plastic 2 liter bottles of beer for $1.25 each. We drink them as we walk back up along the promenade.<br><br>

En-route back to the hostel we run into a patch of ruins right in the middle of a city block. A sign explains that they are Roman ruins which had only been discovered in 2008 when a subway was being dug up. The ruins look as if they were restored and have segments of brick filling in the stone and mortar walls. We decide to play a game of sardines, and count as Nick runs to hide. The rest of us count slowly, wanting the other groups walking through the ruins to come across Nick, crouching among the rubble, before we do. They do. When we are all together again we drink the beer (bad but not terrible,) and reminisce about quirky high school teachers and bad poetry.<br><br>

Leaving our hostel, I find Clement in an unfortunate conversation with a kid who looks about 14 years old saying “at least I own my own business now”, apparently explaining that he used to work at Disney World, but now is living the high life as a produce shipper from Miami to Orlando.<br><br>

The walk to Club Maze, “a local spot serving drinks in a variety of jars, and decorated with old TVs”, takes us near the promenade from earlier, and many of the streets we walk through are filled with construction, high blue walls separating the road from the sidewalk on both sides, forcing us to walk in narrow tunnels. We pick up another big beer to share. I’m surprised by how quiet the streets are for a Friday night, and we see only a few other pedestrians. We reach Club Maze, a black door down an alleyway of shops, and find it closed. All of Sofia seems to be home in bed.<br><br>

We decide to try Club Yalta, an older and well-established, but now touristy, club that seems sure to be open. On the way it starts to rain and we stop at a large, covered outdoor bar that’s the first sign of life we’ve seen thus far, filled with people. We find one of the few open tables in the back.<br><br>

The bar is filled with young people dressed up for an evening out. We put on pants at least, but I felt underdressed in my t-shirt and dirty sneakers. People drink and smoke as the rain drips off the sides of the coverings.<br><br>

I feel tipsy and happy to be surrounded by people. So far, in Bulgaria the people we’ve met have been extremely friendly. I feel very welcome. From the border guard who razzed us about bringing drugs into the country, to the hostel staff, to the men at the trinket stalls, to the restaurant staff and shop owners, everyone has spoken English happily and generously, and has greeted us pleasantly. Similarly at the bar our waitress jokes with us.<br><br>

Given that fact that half of us are single, we want to talk to some Bulgarian girls. There are two tables near us that we hope might reciprocate the feeling. Bennett suggests a bold alternative approach: that I approach one table and point back towards our table saying I’m interested in him, and ask if they have any advice. Unsure of what the end goal is, but up for a laugh, I walk over. At first, they think I’m joking, but then come around to the idea. They can’t offer much advice, but give me two tokens to get into a nearby club for free, and say I should invite him. They then say they have to go. Not a roaring success, but I suppose it could have gone worse.<br><br>

We pour the rest of the cheap beer into our empty cocktail glasses furtively while the waitress is disappears around the corner.<br><br>

On attempt number two, I’m told that asking “Hey where are you from?” isn’t interesting enough, and instead it’s suggested that I go up and ask for a lighter and use it on the (extinguished) candle brought from our table. Skeptical, but open minded, I walk over.<br><br>

I’m a bit abashed but this group is very friendly and thinks it’s funny. Their English is impeccable and they are excited to hear I’m from New York, having been there themselves a few years ago. We talk for awhile and they say they plan to go to the club I had just gotten the tokens for, and say they have two extra. What a stroke of luck. Before long the rest of the boys come over.<br><br>

One girl, Stephani, is an accountant for EY in Plovdiv, one works for the Ministry of Youth development for the government, one works in the car industry in some capacity, and the fourth is the older and less talkative sister of Stephani - it’s her birthday week.<br><br>

The girl who works in the car industry is very skeptical about our planned drive, and recommends we not drive into istanbul, as it is chaos. We laugh and nod along. They tell us that there had been an order literally the night before by the Deputy PM, Valeri Simeonov, to close many of the big clubs in the city, which explains Maze and the quiet of the streets. I ask the reason for the decree and they say some people thought it was because he hadn’t had any fun as a youth, and others think it’s because his son struggled with addiction. They don’t have an official explanation, but explain he has a reputation for hating nightlife.<br><br>

We soon head to Carusel, which is very nearby. We joked earlier in the night whether Bennett would be able to get in wearing tracksuit bottoms, as the boys in Switzerland had told us some clubs there had barred them from entering. We have the perfect 8 tokens to get in for free. We watch a guy in cutoff jean shorts get waved through, but, low and behold, Bennett is stopped. It’s 3:00 AM at this point, so the others opt to head home, but after our great sleep the night before I still have a little energy and tell them I’ll meet them back at the hostel.<br><br>

Inside is one big room with a stage with people dancing on it next to the DJ at the front, and an enclosed rectangle of bars taking up the center of the room. The back is also elevated, with tables of people standing at eye level with the DJ. Black lights and people smoking indoors make the room feel dense. My new friends and I find a standing table at the side of the room. It turns out they are all from Plovdiv, where we would be heading the next day, and they give me recommendations of what to do during our short visit. I stay for another hour or two and say my goodbyes, telling them they have friends in New York the next time they come through.<br><br>

The walk home is warm and quiet, the sky glowing with the anticipation of dawn.<br><br>

<h1>DAY 6, NICK: BUZLUDZHA</h1>

I wake up to a sour smell in our Sofia hostel. At once both hot milk and damp laundry, the smell is so foul that I dress in a hurry and lunge out the door with no second thought given to my unguarded valuables. Once outside, relief washes over me, but out of fear for the general health and wellness of my compatriots I steel my heart and dart back inside. Bennett and Dillon sleep peacefully in their cots. Clement’s bed is empty. <br><br>

We meet on the spiral staircase. Clement tells me he rose early to print out his visa for Turkey. Later, when I mention the smell, Bennett and Dillon tell us they didn’t notice anything. Clement says, “Yeah, it smelled like feet. I thought it’d go away but it never did.” In this moment of foot odor discussion, I feel that Clement and I reach new heights of understanding and personal connection.<br><br>

Our schedule dictates that we must leave Sofia in haste. We decide to cram in two pit stops in before we hit the road. The first is the Alexander Nevsky church, a giant marvel of Byzantine architecture, domed in alternating gold and blue-green copper. Inside, we are greeted by enormous frescoes depicting Biblical passages. A giant Mary holds a giant baby Christ. Various Saints intermingle. The space is quiet and cavernous. I walk around with my hands behind my back because it feels like the right pose to strike. A sign warns us not to take pictures, so Clement and I sling our cameras. As we exit, a robed man approaches Clement and scolds him for his camera. Clement swears that he wasn’t taking any pictures, but his words fall on deaf ears. I quietly pocket my own camera. We leave the church without further incident.<br><br>

The last stop on our farewell tour of Sofia is the Socialist Museum of Art. We skim over the outskirts of town and stroll about the museum garden, admiring the many statues therein. The statues are roughly hewn out of a dark stone, bearing names such as “The Bricklayer” and “Smiling Peasant Women,” save one large installation towards the back of the garden. In this piece, two East German guards sicc dogs upon a large-headed man. A wound in his head spurts a long arc of red blood. The entire effect is cartoonish and frightening. The inscription tells us the piece was commissioned by a Polish remembrance group commemorating a Polish citizen who attempted to flee Soviet-controlled Germany, only to be killed just before the border. It’s a sobering moment as we reflect upon the relative ease with which we’re able to cross similar borders.<br><br>

As we leave the museum, storm clouds gather in the distance and a loud clap of thunder reverberates among the dark stones. The next stop is Plovdiv, a city in Bulgaria I had never heard of, but one that Dillon is especially excited to visit given the city’s history as one of the oldest in Europe. “It’s super fucking old,” he says with excitement in his voice. Bulgaria is a lovely place, and I’m especially excited to be here because my sister Mari was adopted from a city outside Sofia. During my time in Bulgaria we text often. I share pictures and wish she could be here with me. I look forward to my next trip to Bulgaria, during which we’ll undoubtedly be together.<br><br>

I nap in the car and wake when we arrive in Plovdiv. Despite my grogginess, I’m charmed by the city’s many plazas, winding streets, and graffiti art. Giant murals remind me of those we saw in the church in Sofia. People mill about various boutiques beneath brightly-colored banners, palm trees, and a single minaret. At the center of town there’s a space carved out where the ruins of a small Roman amphitheater sit.<br><br>

<div class="caption"> Photo by: Clement Gelly </div><br><br>

We sit down for lunch at a restaurant recommended by the women we met in Sofia. We get the specials of the day - squash salad with yogurt and a generous portion of roasted lamb. The meal is delicious, and after we’re finished our waiter serves us four complimentary shots of Raki - a plum spirit served cold. All told, it’s Dillon’s favorite meal of the trip so far and a strong contender for mine as well. At the time of writing this Dillon claims he could eat three servings all by himself. I don’t doubt him.<br><br>

After lunch we venture to the Old Town, a neighborhood we must reach by walking through a long and empty tunnel. On the other side, we begin to climb up precipitous streets. The Old Town resists modern renovations, retaining its twisting cobblestone streets and old brick buildings, crumbling in places, overgrowing with greenery in others. We head to the ancient theater of Philipoppol, one of the world’s best-preserved Roman theaters. Built in the first century AD, the theater was discovered after a landslide in the 70s revealed its location. We arrive as it begins to rain, the grey clouds contrasting brilliantly with the marble seats of the amphitheater and orchestra. Facing distant mountains and the city scattered below, the theater is a striking sight, remarkable in how near-completion it seems to be - as if the tunnel connecting the old and new towns transported us back in time 1900 years.<br><br>

Since it’s raining, we decide to forego the paid tour and opt to take pictures between the bars of the surrounding gate, sheltered from the rain by a cafe umbrella. The rain picks up into a steady downpour and we quickly realize we’re stranded far from the car. As we plot our next moves, a stray dog pads up to us and lies at our feet. He takes a particular liking to Clement. It feels like a good omen.<br><br>

<img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YHtYCirhATQ/W0e_k50ublI/AAAAAAAAAIM/eFS0b6VHE48yoczDJYJ36RnwtBSIqpIywCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_6858.JPG">

The rain isn’t letting up, so we ask the cafe for garbage bags and don them as makeshift ponchos. The garbage bags are small so we have a little difficulty adjusting them to our wide carriages. Clement, Dillon, and Bennett make holes in the bottoms of their bags and stick their heads through, whereas I opt for the hooded variety. Finally, we’re ready. In the ensuing mad dash I realize two things: tiny garbage bags are not sufficient ponchos and Tevas are not excellent footwear for running on slippery stones. Risking life and limb we slalom down the slick cobblestones, shoes in hand. We pass through the tunnel where a bearded man plays a long flute and make it back to the car soaking wet. After a quick goat milk coffee it’s time to leave.<br><br>

Our schedule has us arriving in Istanbul that night. First we plan to stop at Buzludzha, an abandoned monument of the Bulgarian Communist party located high up in the Balkans. After several hours of driving we arrive at the base of the mountains. We get out of the car for some yoga and light calisthenics and spy Buzludzha, a saucer-shaped building perched high up in the green mountains. The building was originally commissioned to serve as a great assembly hall, built on the location of a late 19th century battle between the Bulgarian rebels and the Ottomans. It fell into disrepair and was closed to the public in the 90s. Inside we’re told that giant murals cover great portions of the walls. It’s one of our most anticipated stops in Bulgaria, and as we climb up the mountain, through misty forests along winding roads, our excitement mounts.<br><br>

After an hour or two spent navigating the fog we arrive at a gate. We get out of the car and begin to hike up a mountain pass. We hike for a long time as the fog grows thick and we lose visibility. Seemingly out of nowhere a tower appears out of the fog. We realize we’ve climbed to the wrong monument. We hike back down and course correct, and soon we’ve arrived at a large empty lot below Buzludzha. There, two enormous hands hold two enormous torches, sculpted out of black stone. Buzludzha sits above, imperious in the fog. The monument exemplifies Brutalist architecture prevalent in Soviet buildings. The hands and torches are sculpted with crude cuts which seemingly come from the mountain itself. Buzludzha sits like a smooth river stone some stories above. After taking in the hands and the sunset over the landscape below, we begin or climb up to the monument. The slope is steep and perilous, and as we climb the sun sinks below the mountains. Soon it’s very dark. Once we reach the top, the full hulk of Buzludzha is astounding. The monument is enormous, and as the fog whips up and across the enjoining tower I feel cowed by the dark power of the structure. It seems to suck light.<br><br>

The four of us split up and explore the exterior in silence. Graffiti covers the walls. From up close it’s apparent the building has been abandoned for some time. The walls are crumbling and sharp spikes of rusted rebar jut out at violent angles. As far as we’re aware, we’re totally alone. This illusion is shattered when I round a corner and spot a tiny hut with a light on inside. After driving several hours up a rural mountain it’s shocking to see a sign of life. I approach the hut slowly. Inside, a security guard slides open a window and says something in Bulgarian. When I say, “English?” he scowls at me and asks me what I’m doing here. I tell him I only want to explore the exterior. He says we’re not allowed inside because the roof is caving in, and we part in an uneasy peace. I meet up with the rest of the boys below. The security guard’s light gleams like an eye on the side of the monument. We descend to our car. Buzludzha melts into a dark shape, then vanishes in the fog.<br><br>

The visit casts a spell on me, and for much of our descent down the mountain and through the rest of Bulgaria, I sleep. I awake at the Border crossing into Turkey where we’re grilled by a border guard about our itinerary after an incident in which Bennett mistakenly speeds past the guard booth then screeches to a halt as we realize our error. In all fairness, the booths are poorly marked and there’s a line at a secondary booth where we think we have to stop instead. We pass without further incident and again I nod into sleep. It seems like no time has passed when the car jolts to a stop and it’s 5:00 AM and we’re in Istanbul. I clamber out of the car, shrugging the cloak of sleep from my shoulders. As we enter the hostel the Call to Prayer rings out through the streets.<br><br>

<h1>DAY 7, CLEMENT: ISTANBOOLIN’ IT</h1>

We start our morning with a stroll through our neighborhood, Karikoy, and find an outdoor cafe to drink Turkish coffee and water. The sun is beating down already and this will be the first of our innumerable Turkish-coffee-and-water stops of the day. From the cafe we walk to eat kofte near the river and then walk across a bridge spanning the Golden Horn to wander through Eminonu, the old city. <br><br>

We peruse the spice market, before heading to a baklava place. Here we are met after some minutes by my dear friend from college, Safak, who moved back to Istanbul after our graduation to do a masters in chemistry. Safak takes it upon himself to be our guide for the day, and expertly leads us along the streets to the Hagia Sofia. Something I noticed at our border crossing from Bulgaria, over the course of our few hours walking through the city, and especially surrounding the Hagia Sofia, is that policemen armed with machine guns wear only jeans, t-shirts, sneakers, and a vest that says “Police” to indicate their authority. It strikes me that there is something uncanny about authority without its proper uniform, which leads me to consider how and why we allow a uniform to signify power in such a way. I ask Safak about this. “Yeah! A lot of people visiting ask me about this,” he says. There is a pause. “...I don’t know why they don’t have uniforms.”<br><br>

The Hagia Sofia is an enormous 6th century cathedral that was converted to a mosque by the Ottomans, and then to a museum by the Turkish government in the 20th century. Inside we are uniformly awed by its size, intricacy, marble floors smoothed over by the better half of two millennia of feet, Christian mosaics, and large Islamic scripts. On the second floor, Safak shows us the graffiti of a Viking Roman guard, apparently named Halvard, who carved his name onto a marble balustrade.<br><br>

After lying in the grass outside the Blue Mosque and making a pit stop for more coffee and water we take a bus to the Ottoman walls of the old city - enormous crumbling stone walls that separated the peninsula from the rest of the land mass. We sit atop the walls, mostly in silence, gazing out at the sprawling cityscape of rooftops, minarets, domes, and the Golden Horn. There’s a man already up there when we arrive, and he strikes up a conversation with Safak in Turkish. Apparently he had been in Istanbul only 3 days, looking for work, and asks Safak to point out where he might find a job. Safak doesn’t know where he might find a job. The man clarifies he doesn’t mean specific places, just neighborhoods. Safak says he doesn’t know about that either.<br><br>

The high vantage point gives some clarity to my thoughts, and I contemplate our trip thus far. As many people have pointed out to us, 6 weeks is a very short amount of time to cover so much ground, and many have been skeptical of how little time we will have in each country. But as I think back through the past week, doing the trip with such speed has given us an otherwise impossible sense of the gradient of the landscapes, architectures, histories and languages through which we have passed so far. In the Alps, coniferous trees sprung up before fading back to deciduous, and now in Istanbul we can see palm trees in the mix too. In Ljubljana and Serbia we saw Austro-Hungarian-era buildings, which were side by side with communist brutalist apartment buildings in Belgrade. These same buildings sprawled across Bulgaria as well, but here mix with enormous Orthodox churches, Ottoman-era buildings, and the first mosques we had seen so far. In Serbia and Bulgaria, signs were half in the Roman alphabet and half in Cyrillic. Looking out over Istanbul, I am impressed, as most are, by how the city is a tapestry of historical periods, with its Roman aqueducts, Byzantine churches, early Ottoman walls, late Ottoman mosques, and modern office buildings - all undulating in a sea of low-rise terra-cotta-roofed houses.<br><br>

But more than all that, there is the irreducible lived experience of traveling this enormous distance by land, Knowing what it is to go between all these places on the same continuous path. We have seen the English Channel and the Bosphorus in the same week by land journey, and we know something more, something perhaps apprehended and inexpressible. <br><br>

“What are you guys talking about?” I ask Safak. “He says people keep telling him to look for jobs on the internet but he tells them he doesn’t have a computer. They tell him to use his phone but he tells them he’s already used all his data to watch porn.” We walk down the wall and stop in a nearby mosque before heading towards a cafe with another panoramic view. Within the grounds of the mosque, everything feels quieter and calmer, the temperature more moderate. A man washes his face at a fountain. Inside, two men pray.<br><br>

After some coffee and water at the cafe, where we watch the sunset, we head to a favorite restaurant of Safak’s, which mostly serves offal. We order a bottle of Raki, guts two ways (stuffed and fried), thymus, liver and testicle. Waiting for the food, we pour ourselves a shot of raki each, to be mixed with ice and water. Safak pours himself a double shot and adds no water. When I point this out, Safak nods and says, “Yeah I’m hardcore. Turkish shit is my shit.” The food arrives; it is all oily and buttery, not just novel to us, but genuinely delicious.<br><br>

After dinner, we head to Istiklal, a street with many bars and clubs. Since it is a Sunday, we don’t find too much, but Safak takes us to a bar with a signature schnapps/gin/soda drink that is consumed by covering the glass with napkins, slamming it on the table, and chugging it as it foams excessively. We all have a few of these, before bidding our wonderful host goodbye, and returning to the Cheers Midtown Hostel.<br><br>

<h1>DAY 8, BENNETT: BACKGAMMON AGAIN WITH THEM WHITE VANS</h1>

Convinced to stay in Istanbul for a second day by Safak, we wake up in the Cheers Midtown Hostel. The weather is again very hot and humid. At the recommendation of the hostel owner we eat at a restaurant near the hostel, including small plates of musaka, lentil soup, a sort of pumpkin latke, grilled eggplant and peppers.<br><br>

Next we walk to the golden horn and across to the old side of Istanbul. Stopping back at the Spice Market we pick up 1KG of Turkish delight for $2.50 and some dates for our future travels.<br><br>

We then walk to the grand bazaar and pick up some items on our list: a pot to make Turkish coffee, a mini backgammon set, and a billowy shirt/pant set for Nick.
The only thing we do not find are billowy pants for Nick.<br><br>

We sit on the lawn of the Topkapi Palace and play backgammon. I lose 3/2 of a cup of coffee to Nick (he bet on Dillon who had less favorable odds vs. Clement, some would call it an upset). Nick puts on his billowy shirt.<br><br>

Next we make our way to Cigeristan, a restaurant that serves grilled meat and vegetables. In 2013 while studying in Jordan, I spent about a week in Istanbul and had eaten at this restaurant multiple times. Shout out to Nick Silva who was there with me in 2013 and helped me find it again. <br><br>

We wash down lamb doner kebabs, grilled peppers, cilantro and onions with some frothy, salty yogurt called laban. Next, we break out the backgammon board.<br><br>

Upon seeing the board, our waiter’s face suddenly becomes stern as he makes eye contact with Clement. At first I think he’s upset that he won’t be able to turn over the table for longer, but soon it becomes clear that he is cautiously excited that we might be playing backgammon (he spoke no English so he wasn’t sure if it was the same game). His face lights up when Dillon confirms that his Google translation of Talva (in Turkish) is correct. <br><br>

About fifteen minutes later, once I finish playing Dillon, he stops by and indicates he’d like to play a game. Standing and leaning over the table, he moves the pieces quickly and knows the correct moves for my pieces based on my dice rolls well before I do. However, I have three helpers pointing out the moves I should make along with me. He calls out Clement for helping me on a particularly crucial move but seems okay with it because he recognizes we’re brothers. For those of you familiar with backgammon, the turning point of the game occurs when I have one of his pieces captured and all the spaces where he could roll back in covered except for the four. On his side he has all six spaces covered. He rolls a four and a two, not only freeing his piece that I had captured but capturing one of mine. Unable to roll back in for at least a few turns, I know it’s over. We shake hands and he brings us unlimited Turkish Tea on the house for the rest of the evening.<br><br>

Next we head to the Hotel de Londres, back on the new side of the golden horn near our hostel. We sit on the roof and watch the sunset while drinking raki and bamonte beer. This is a recommendation of Safak and the view is possibly the best we’ve seen of Istanbul, thanks again Safak!<br><br>

<img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-u-RSUzcHOWw/W0fSf34KZ4I/AAAAAAAAALY/svIdo8tiajo3ZN9RkUaYjGxNW7znHg32wCEwYBhgL/s1600/IMG_7020.JPG">
<div class="caption"> Photo by: Clement Gelly </div><br><br>

We walk down Istiklal back towards our hostel. <br><br>

There is one detail that I left out of the previous blog post about Belgrade that I wrote, ‘Second Try Guys’, which is that we bought bleach because Dillon wanted to look like Aaron Maine and had floated the idea of bleaching our hair. With Robert Pattinson of Good Time in mind, Clement was soon on board. I don’t have anyone in mind but according to my older brother Piers, based on photos, I turn out looking like a juggalo without the face paint. Because bleaching Nick’s hair would be a travesty, he does not join in. <br><br>

When we get back to the hostel we begin the process. Dillon and Clement open the hair dying sets, mix a few bottles together with the rubber gloves provided and we massage and comb the paste it into our hair in the hostel bathroom. Within 20 minutes the effects are noticeable and our scalps are burning (though slightly less so for Clement who has lots of hair). <br><br>

After washing the goo from our hair we’re looking pretty orange, but decide nonetheless to take a boat to the Asian side of Istanbul, the Kadıköy neighborhood in particular. The ferry ride is about and hour. When we arrive we walk around the neighborhood, which was pretty low key as it’s a Monday night. We have a beer at a couple of bars and not longer after take a cab back to the hostel.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
