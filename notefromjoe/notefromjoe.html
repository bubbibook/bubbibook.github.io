                I have this light blue Crossley record player that they sell at Urban Outfitters but which I got for free from my friend’s apartment when they moved places last summer. That was over a year ago, but I only just bought my first records for it a couple of months ago. Today I’m listening to Sam Cooke, Portrait of a Legend: 1951-1964. It’s amazing. The weather is just starting to get cold as we prepare to launch. I’m bundled up drinking coquito, I’ve got my little muji aroma diffuser going - so my whole room smells like literal LOVE (that’s the name of the essential oil, it’s a lavender and Rosemary blend) - and I’m feeling HOT! That’s sorta what this book is all about. Good energy, man.<br><br>
      Since high school, my friends and I have all called each other "bubbi," (“What’s up bubbi?” “All the bubbis are gonna be there” “It’ll be an absolute bub fest” etc.) It comes from the name of the whale<br> (spelt B-u-b-b-i-e) in the Cartoon Network show Flapjack. Bubbie is Flapjack’s adoptive mother as well as his home. Like, Flapjack literally lives in Bubbie’s mouth. I’ve always loved that. Home is where the bubbi is.<br><br>

      This 'book' is gonna keep filling up with tons of cool stuff from lots of bubbis, but I couldn’t have put any of this together without the incomparable Erika Jaquez. She literally did 99% of all the work and <br>she’s the best artist I know.
      <br><br>
      ENJOY!
