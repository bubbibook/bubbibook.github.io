<div id="maintitle"> LONDON TO MONGOLIA:<br> DAYS ONE-FOUR</div>

      <div class="intro">
        Inspired by the journey of Mr. Tom and Mr. Joolz, who started the tradition of the Mongol Rally decades ago, we planned a trip similar yet specifically distinct. Buying one way plane tickets to London, unsure of how far we would get, our end-goal was blurry. We wanted to make it to Mongolia, but a number of times, especially towards the end as we realized what would be required to make that a reality, we happily considered alternatives.
          In retrospect, we can point to our underpreparedness as the cornerstone of our approach. We blindly entered situations both wonderful and dangerous, we relied on others to the point of debasement, and made decisions on-the-run with minimal consideration of what steps led to them or what consequences would follow. The freedom was exalting.
<br><br>
    Love,
    The Rally Boys<br><br>Dillon, Nick, Clement, and Bennett

      <h1 id="title"> Day One, Dillon: <br> Tubular Fellas ft. <br> Piers, Rico, Damian, <br>Tim & Adi </h1>

      <div id="bighead"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QVVzI8a.jpg"> </div>

      11:00 pm Sunday night, the 1st of July. I arrive in London to meet Bennett and Clement after 22 hours of travel.  We drink a beer and sleep for two and a half hours. On the way to our 8:00 am Ferry to Dunkirk, we buy two sausage sandwiches and no pasties from Greggs, coffee from Costa, and a cassette tape from a charity shop, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXvtDm820zI"> Tubular Bells.</a>
      The white cliffs of Dover spread out behind us as the ferry embarks. The on-deck gift shop pulls us in with a gravity we aren’t bothered about resisting, and there’s some dispute about how to spend our last six pounds sterling. The question is whether or not to buy the legally required Great Britain sticker for driving in the EU. We ultimately decide that 12 will get us farther than 6, and invest in the slot machines.  Slot roulette isn't kind to us, but the machine is next to the VIP lounge, and we watch a woman punch in a door code. Inspired, we complain to the hostess that our own code isn’t working and she lets us in. Once inside we indulge on macaroons, espresso, and mimosas.
      We dock at 11:00 pm and realize it’s going to take an hour and half longer than we anticipated to get to Charles de Gaulle to pick up Nick. Still, we drive slowly through the golden fields of Dunkirk as we acclimate to being on the wrong side of the road. We arrive at the terminal 2 hours late but only 5 minutes after Nick, his flight having been delayed perfectly. The foursome is complete, and Maurice, our little red wagon, feels balanced at last.

      We pass through half a dozen little French one-road towns on the way to Zurich.  As we continue south, the landscape becomes greener and more rugged, the lazy hills gradually rumbling up into rocky peaks. Scattered thunderstorms mark our progress and clean the petrified bird shit off of our sunroof, allowing the intermittent sunlight to pour in hot.
      We find ourselves in a tiny village built around a central church. The buildings are all made of soft brown stone and the streets are narrow. Side B of Tubular Bells climaxes as we crest the hill up towards the only gas station in town, seated next to a massive, modern, and jarring Costco-like grocery store. While wandering sleepily through the store, picking up food and camping supplies, we realize that Switzerland will be playing in the World Cup tomorrow - the same time we would be in Zurich. We enjoy a picnic of brie, sausage, apples, and a baguette in the parking lot and decide to stay the full day in Zurich in order to enjoy the game and watch it with our Swiss friends.

      Bennett and Clement sleep through the border crossing from France to Switzerland it's so uneventful - simply a coned route around an unoccupied guard post. Having lost an hour to zones, we get to the city around 11:30 and park outside of our friend Rico's apartment. Rico and Damian, our other host, pull up from work a minute later.
      We say happy hellos and go up. Rico's long skinny apartment ends in a large living room with a balcony. Tim and Adi join us and we sit around a table on the balcony and catch up, talking about our plans. We pile into two cars and drive to Longstrossen, the late night part of town, for sandwiches.

      <br>
      We walk in a pack through the beer can littered streets and avoid eye contact with the prostitutes who call out to us. Prostitution is legal in Switzerland, and in this area on Monday night after midnight there aren't many other people out and about.
      Damian brings us into a 24 hour sandwich shop and helps us translate our orders.  On this dirty and seedy street, this sandwich shop, well-lit and organized, feels out of place. We pick our bread, spreads, meat, and vegetables, and the man toasts it all in a panini press. It’s delicious and satisfying after the 9 hours since our last meal.
      The 8 of us drive to Damian's place after he offers to let the 4 of us stay in his room. We make plans to swim in the river in the morning and say our goodbyes.

  <div id="bighead"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3cvdqAA.png"> </div> <br><br>

I like to think of a storm as a room you have no choice but to enter. First, you are encircled in curtains of rain. A ceiling draws gradually near. Rather than choose it, it chooses you. It comes down to luck.
Of all species of storms, morning storms are the most remarkable. They smudge the barrier between sleep and waking hours, pulling each into the other so that we lose sight of the threshold between the two and inhabit both. It's in this dreamlike stupor -abetted by our jet lag- that we awake in our first and only full day in Zurich. Thunder rattles the panes of glass in the windows, and lightning arcs across the sky. Ignoring Damian and Rico’s protestations that we can't swim in a thunderstorm, we head to the river bank, a mere hundred feet from Rico's apartment.

<div class="day two">
The Limmat is bottle-green and amazingly clear, brooked on either side by concrete levees. The water is surprisingly warm, the current swift. A swan noses the green bank downriver. Despite the fauna, the landscape is industrial, girded by steel bridges and chain link fences. A monolithic, sand-colored building twenty stories tall looms over us, pocking the grey sky. A sign on the side reads "Kornhaus" and when we joke of silos Rico informs us it in fact holds grain. I imagine an office building inundated with golden piles of corn threatening to burst through the windows. From a bridge yawning above us hangs a long swing. The storm has calmed into a soft rain, and we take turns on this makeshift perch, dipping our toes in the clear, fast-moving water.

Showers and coffee: our second and third blessings after the morning storm. The sky clears while we talk about painting with the boys. Damian and Rico are painters and describe their hobby as freeing, creativity an act of rebellion. I admire them for the smiles on their faces while they describe it all to us.

The boys head to work at the "Public Viewing", an outdoor venue that broadcasts soccer matches and serves bratwurst and beer. Later we'll join them there to watch the Switzerland vs. Sweden World Cup match. Until then we meander the city, heading towards the most expensive street in Zurich: Bonhofstrausse. Crossing lock bridges over the Limmat we pass beneath steeples and clock towers. The city along the water is disarmingly charming, reminding me of the tiny mechanical towns that adorn cuckoo clocks. By now the sun is out, glinting the water.

      </div>



We cross onto Bonhofstrausse, a long road shouldered by expensive watch stores whose names are decorated by umlauts, fancy chocolatiers, fast fashion complexes, and, bizarrely, a Claire's, which, for those not in the know, is a cheap jewelry store I associate with defunct strip malls in Midwestern towns. I buy a few rolls of film, Clement buys an SD card to iPhone adapter, and all four of us share a mediocre bag of Swiss chili orange chocolate. Next, we head to Lake Zurich, a giant paradisal lake in the center of town, which, to my horror, is stalked by roving gangs of swans. In my opinion, swans are terrible.
We sit at the bank of Lake Zurich, admiring the far-off sailboats, clear blue sky, and reclining lovers. Amazing that just this morning rain was pulverizing the pavement. I take some photos and shy away from the inquisitive swans that worry my feet, begging for bread. We lunch on ham and cheese sandwiches, then set off for the Public Viewing.
At the Viewing we encounter some serious Swiss hospitality. Damian and Rico work the grill and bar respectively, and introduce us to their friends and coworkers Adi, Said, Tim, and Sammy. Rico's dad owns and operates the Viewing. He shows us to one of the many picnic tables set up in front of a giant screen and bedecks us in Switzerland T-shirts and scarves. Rico smuggles us free beer and Damian gives us any grilled item our hearts desire. We pledge to return the favor the next time they come to America.

<div class="day two">
Switzerland loses the match. I don't follow soccer much, but I enjoy the rowdy atmosphere up until the end. By the time the game ends the crowded tent is full to the gills of groaning fans. Some cry. Two young boys at our table, decked out in their team's finery, bang their heads on the table. We retire to a churchyard nearby and take a short snooze. The following England vs. Columbia game is similarly disappointing, with Columbia losing in overtime after a tense bout of penalty kicks. After the match we help the boys sweep the floors and wipe the tables, and I take pleasure in working for our piece. When the work's done all ten of us caravan to the street we visited the previous night, a little more alive this time. Adi passes around a bottle of Serbian schnapps his friend made and we barhop from spot to spot, drinking in the cool, electric night.

  <h1 id="title"> Day 3, Clement: <br> accidental Germany<br> ft. Olga </h1>
  <div id="bighead"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gV5Cczc.png"> </div>
We awake four in a row on Damian’s bed, lying perpendicular to standard bed orientation. The room smells of feet, because of us. We can hear rap playing from another room in the apartment. “I’m not ready to meet anyone new right now,” says Dillon, looking a bit bewildered in his first few minutes of the new day.
<br>
The music is coming from Rico’s girlfriend Olga, who lives with Damian. She is very friendly, accepts our offer of French pressed coffee, and tells us a bit about her career as a tattoo artist. She did Tim’s back piece, a wonderful jungle scene in black and white. We cook some oatmeal, and eat it in turns with a single spoon. Olga does not partake, as it is very dry and bland, but offers us some honey as flavor.

We wish her goodbye, and express our hopes to all meet again. We set off for Serbia by way of Padua, Italy; I, Clement am driving. All goes swimmingly, save a small google maps error that sends us back and forth through the same Zurich tunnel twice. We are making great time through the Swiss alps, which are very pointy and nice. Nick and Dillon are rocked asleep by my smooth driving through the curved mountain highways. We pass through a very long tunnel, when I am hit by a sudden realization.
<br><br>
“Bennett, I think we’re in Germany.”
<br><br>
Sure enough, we have accidentally entered Deutschland—an event now known to us as “accidental Germany” — which is made even more real by the fact that we are on the Autobahn, and Audis and Benzs are flying past us at 130mph. Maurice makes it up to his record speed of 105mph on a downhill turn.
Google maps rerouted us through Germany and Austria when we were in Zurich for unknown reasons, explaining the second pass through the same tunnel. We embrace our new route, stopping at an Austrian gas station for sandwich accoutrements, and eat them next to two Austrian truck drivers each with a burger, a shot of espresso, a shot of clear liquor, and a grapefruit juice in front of them. Some cows eat grass across the road.

    </div>

<div class="caption"> Photo by: Dillon Kraus </div>
On our way back to the highway, we pick up some salad from a SPAR, since we are all feeling a bit malnourished from a few days of sausage sandwiches, hamburgers and beer. We drink some kefir to “help Nick stay regular,” eat some carrots and tomatoes in the car, which are very delicious and improve our spirits.
Our route brings us next through Slovenia. My friend and former coworker, Kaja, is Slovenian, and she has told us to stop at Lake Bled, a lake with a small island in the middle on which there is a church. It’s only 15 minutes off the highway, so we make a short detour to the lake. This brings us passed signs for an intriguing but unexplained “Dino Park,” which our time budget simply cannot accommodate, but we gaze longingly.
<br><br>
We drive down to the lakeside; it is a beautiful orange evening, and the water is calm and deep. We quickly make the decision to go swimming, wet swim trunks and towels be damned. Nick, Bennett and Dillon dive right in, but I go up to my knees and then am frozen by my hatred of being a little bit cold in water. As it turns out, we are just to the left of a very tall diving board, which is fenced off on all sides except that it is on a lake. It belongs to a nearby hotel. The three in the water immediately head for the diving board, and climb up on the deck. Dillon motions for me to take photos of them. I begrudgingly accept my role as coward who must thusly document the others’ fun. Eventually though, I wade out around the fence and then onto the deck, and take a few more photos of them before preparing to take the plunge myself.

<div class="day three">
Someone yells at us from outside the fence: “Hey! How’d you guys get in there?” Thinking they are from the hotel, we look at each other for a moment before Bennett yells back, somewhat uncertainly, “hotel?” The man asks again. “Hotel!” I yell and jump off the diving board. The water is cold but not too cold, the lake water smooth and refreshing.

We swim back to the shore, and return to our car to change back into our shorts. As we all change beneath too-small towels, we narrowly miss changing in front of a several-car tourist train that drives by.

We make it to Ljubljana, Slovenia’s capital, by night time. We have a stroll through a few of its beautiful squares, stroll along its river and have a delicious ice cream each. But soon enough, we head back to our car to get back on the highway; we want to make it as far as Serbia tonight.

Around midnight we are at a quarter tank, so stop at a gas station in Croatia to refuel. The gas station is not self service; we cannot refuel. We weigh all our options, decide it would be unwise to keep along the highway with no sense of where the next gas or sleeping area might be, so we post up for the night. We make a quick midnight salad on the roof in our Tupperware boxes, using the signature Gelly family salad dressing recipe (inquire for details).

<div class="caption"> Photo by:Clement Gelly </div>
We debate whether or not to pitch a tent near our car, but somehow, inexplicably, decide to all four of us sleep in the back of the car. We put down all the seats, move all our luggage to the roof, and all pile in.
What might be spacious for two, acceptable for three, is like a mild form of torture for four. There is no possible arrangement in which someone or everyone’s feet and/or arms are not falling asleep and have sharp pains shooting through their hip bones pressed into the hard car seat. At first we try all four of us spooning, but we give this up for head-to-toe. Eventually I wedge my head between the two front seats in an effort to remove my torso from the central fray and am able to fall asleep. Some unquantifiable time later, Dillon wakes me up and firmly reprimands me for taking up more than half the car with my “broad shoulders.” Dillon later tells us that “I was so squeezed in at one point I thought I was going to pop out,” no longer even touching the car bed. This night is widely regarded as nightmarish, though I maintain it was not so bad and I was not hogging space.
</div>

<br>

<div class="day four">

<h1 div id="title"> Day 4, Bennett ft. <br>Mean Kid, Mean Lady,<br> Racist Guy, Evil GPS,<br> Aunt Helen (phone):<br>Second Try Guys </h1>
<div id="bighead"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/sIJ6NZC.png"> </div>

It’s 2:00 am and I’m lying on my side in the back of Maurice, firmly sandwiched between Dillon and the plastic hump covering the rear wheel. This is the result of poor planning and the fact that the four of us can only lie down in the car by strapping the contents of the trunk to the roof, folding down the seats and spooning in the resulting 4 foot wide space.

As we desperately try to arrange ourselves in sleep-able positions, each of our movements sets off a chain reaction of adjustments to our bodies, aligned head-to-toe, which in turn sets off the car alarm, repeatedly. We try leaving the doors unlocked to avoid setting off the alarm but they automatically lock after about two minutes. We try leaving the door slightly ajar to avoid this, but it triggers the overhead lights in the car. We try to unscrew the lights so they don’t drain the car battery but we can’t remove them all. We lie perfectly still, trying not to move or laugh, and fall asleep after about 20 minutes.
<br><br>
Less than an hour later, I am awake again. It takes me a minute to realize my body has woken me up because my right leg is fully asleep from the knee down. I attempt to unwedge myself from the crevice I’ve slowly sunken into and remove the weight from my aching shoulder, and the whole car is now awake. A brief discussion ensues about how Clement is lying in the direct center of the trunk, meaning by definition that Dillon and I have less space than he and Nick. Clement responds that he is doing this so he can fit his head between the seats and free up space by his feet (my head). We curse ourselves for not stopping to find a camping spot earlier. This repeats every 45 minutes until around 7:00 am, when we finally gave up.

Dillon and Clement go into the nearby gas station to pay for fuel while I stare blankly at the inside of the car door, my mind fuzzy. When Dillon returns he chuckles at my forlorn face and tells me everything is going to be okay. Inspired by the cheerful attitude of a guy who just spent five hours pressed up against me in positions that he said he’d “never done before with anybody”, I begin to prepare for the day ahead.

Nick and I clean and repack the car while Clement and Dillon christen our double burner, whipping up a breakfast of eggs, beans and coffee. Soon we are back on the road, driving from who knows where, Croatia to Belgrade, Serbia.

<br><br>
We make it to Belgrade in four hours. After several attempts, I’m able to park the the car, and we walk towards a popular street for restaurants. After about 15 minutes, we realize that unless we go back to the car immediately we would not remember where it was parked. We walk back and after a short bathroom break we’re back on our way. At this point I realize we are "second try guys.""
<br><br>

After a lunch of crunchy chicken, we made our way to Kalemegdan. Kalemegdan is a citadel/park on the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers. It was originally built in the 3rd century B.C by a Celtic tribe, later conquered by the Romans, Goths and Huns and then rebuilt by the Byzantines in the 6th century A.D and continued to change rulers many times. We sit on top of the stone wall in the sun where there is a beautiful view of the Danube and Sava meeting.

<div class="day three">
Next, we walk through the city towards a central pedestrian street. We pass through displays of missiles, tanks and artillery from different time periods. A group knights re-enact a changing of a guard at the gate of Kalemegdan. We wonder if they would chase Dillon into the adjacent dinosaur park if he pretended to steal my camera and I called for help.

We pause for a minute to watch two elderly men play tennis on orange clay courts as two young men heckle them from afar.

A young boy passes and his eyes catch the keyboard we bought that morning and had been carrying around.
<br><br>
‘That keyboard sucks.'<br>
‘It was only $9.'<br>
‘It’s not worth it.'<br>
"We’ll see," I think to myself.
<br><br>
We arrive at the big central pedestrian street with shops on either side and sit outside at a cafe. Dillon and I order the usual, a Watermelon Man and a Purple Rain, respectively. Not long after, Purple Rain, by Prince, starts to play at the cafe. In the spirit of the moment, Dillon orders some tiny pies, which turn out not to be pies at all.

We head back to the car and stop to pick up some groceries. We need help identifying whether or not what we have in our hands is a bottle of bleach.
Dillon tries to get a nice-looking woman to help translate.
<br><br>
“Excuse me, is this bleach?”
“I don’t speak English.” She sounds disgusted that Dillon and I assumed she might.
<br><br>
I try my luck on a man who proceeds to read the entirety of the fine print on the bottle- before making two jumps in the conversation, first to his love for Trump and then on to his hatred for Jews. It was time to leave Belgrade.

Our final destination for the day was the house of my (and Clement’s) aunt, Helen, in Bulgaria. It’s in a small town called Grolska Padina close to the border with Serbia. We soon realize we have no address for the house besides Grolska Padina, Bulgaria and text Aunt Helen for help. She responds that there is no “real address” but indicates that the house is on the intersection of the main road and... “another street”. She sends some pictures to help. The road signs and accuracy of our GPS app had begun to worsen after we crossed the border from Serbia into Bulgaria, and at one point the app attempted to murder us by directing us down a road which turned out to be an exit ramp from the highway we were trying to enter. None the less, we finally arrive in Grolska Padina around 3:00 am.
<br><br>
There is a thick fog on the road, limiting our vision to about two or three car lengths ahead of us. We spend 30 minutes driving through the narrow roads holding up our phones to compare pictures with the houses we pass. I begin to suspect the GPS is leading us into some sort of trap after failing to kill us on the exit ramp, and Nick suggests pitching our tents. Just as I’m starting to let go of my hopes for a bed, laundry, and kitchen, Aunt Helen texts us directions in reference to the town pump, which we are able to follow through the fog. Relieved, we cook a quick dinner of pasta and salad, pile our laundry in the washer and collapse by 5:00 am.
