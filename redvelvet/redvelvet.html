<div id ="dividers"><strong>ENTR’ACTE.</strong><br><br></div>
<i>One time I dated a hot guy who made me super nervous. So super nervous that the inside of my mouth would swell up and make me feel like an inarticulate squirrel. So nervous that rivers of sweat ran off my palms and into his hands whenever he was holding mine. He wasn’t a very Nice Hot Guy. He wasn’t a very Interesting Hot Guy. He is, however, the Hot Guy who witnessed one of my greatest Life Fears come to fruition during my first visitation to his Brooklyn abode.</i>
<br><br>

<div id ="dividers"><strong>ACT I.</strong><br><br></div>
The circumstances surrounding this trip to <strong>The Hot Guy’s</strong> apartment were innocuous enough. He had texted me earlier that fateful day to make some “casual plans” (his words, of course) and as the evening rolled around, it became clear that <strong>The Hot Guy</strong> and myself would be spending a magical evening together.<br><br>

<i>Joy.</i><br><br>

Initially, the plan was to accompany his Cool Friend to a tres chic, tres ~exclusive~ soiree at a Secret Meme Art Gallery (yes, you read that correctly)—truly the zenith of hip-happenin’-hipster events. But <strong>The Hot Guy</strong> had turned down the invitation, coolly explaining to me that he’d rather “Y’know...just like, chill. At home. With, uh, like a movieorsomething. And get us, like a large pizza.”<br><br>

And get us a large pizza he did.<br><br>

A large, cheeseless pizza.<br><br>

At the time, I thought he was a true romantic.<br><br>

While eating this pizza—a sacrilegious creation in the eyes of Deep-Dish and Sicilian lovers alike—we sat in an awkward, SuperNerve induced silence. <strong>The Hot Guy’s</strong> roommate broke the discomfort, sauntering into the kitchen and offering us a hit of his bong. He was: Extremely Shirtless and Incredibly Ripped.<br><br>

But, ah, a solo Shirtless Adonis wasn’t enough. The universe wanted to make my nerves unbearable and render my social skills useless. I then had the absolute esteemed privilege of meeting five more of <strong>This Hot Guy’s</strong> Best Friends. A stream of young, attractive, successful, 20-somethings glided through their front door in matching white sneakers and light wash denim.<br><br>

They Juuled with confidence reserved exclusively for hot Brooklynites and popular 16 years olds whose parents are irresponsibly chill.<br><br>

“Dude,” <strong>The Hot Guy</strong> said as he cleared my slice of pizza before I had even finished half of it, “I can’t wait for you to meet these dudes. They are, like, very chill.”<br><br>

To no one’s surprise, <strong>The Hot Guy</strong> was not the award winner for Most Likely to Make a Social Situation Not Awkward. He was not, in fact, a nominee. Nor was he on the committee. Or even invited to the award ceremony as someone else’s plus one.<br><br>

Despite my very obvious discomfort with this suddenly high-pressure situation, I managed to avoid total and complete catastrophe. I managed to squeak out a compliment to one of his friends about his music taste and the friend replied, “Wow <strong>The Hot Guy</strong>, she’s a keeper!”<br><br>

My inwardly-distressed, outwardly-placid self screamed bloody murder on repeat inside the sanctuary of my mental sewer.<br><br>

<div id ="dividers"><strong>ACT II.</strong><br><br></div>
The hot Brooklyn people finally fled to attend their galleries for Memes and suck upon their pens for vaping. <strong>The Hot Guy</strong> was left to his own devices, propositioning me in the least casual trying-to-be-casual way: “Soooo….. <i>wannawatchamovie?</i>”<br><br>

<i>(Author’s Note:</i> For those of you who are unfamiliar: the term	“Sooo...<i>wannawatchamovie?</i>” equates to exactly one minute and twenty-three seconds of the fifth installment of “Pirates of the Caribbean” (including the opening credits). )<br><br>

And then we began— the <i>relations</i>. At this point, it was a healthy …10:15pm? The <i>relations</i> continued at a steady clip, but then <strong>The Hot Guy</strong> surprised my whole self with the following: “I am so sorry, but I am absolutely exhausted. I literally am usually asleep by 10:30pm. Do ya wanna just…stay over?”<br><br>

Instead of saying what I actually wanted like a sane person, instead, I got shy and muttered: “Uh, do you want me to?”<br><br>

Fuck me, right?<br><br>

Because I am nothing if not desperate in my need for constant validation from everyone I know.<br><br>

“Yes!” he says. “But only if you want to, and it’s not too inconvenient.”<br><br>

I agreed.<br><br>

This—dear reader—was a mistake.<br><br>

<div id ="dividers"><strong>ACT III.</strong><br><br></div>

<i>5:30 am and I feel—moisture?</i><br><br>

We are still intertwined. I think—<br><br>

<i>Ew. Ugh.</i> HOOOO <i>boy am I WARM. I am sweating through every orifice, every pore. This is gross. Wait.</i><br><br>

…<br><br>
…<br><br>
…<br><br>

<i>Sweat isn’t this…sticky. Or thick. And it also isn’t supposed to smell like iron.</i><br><br>

…<br><br>
…<br><br>
…<br><br>

 <i>It’s blood.<br><br>

 	Oh my god.<br><br>

 It is blood.</i><br><br>

And blood it was! Copious amounts of surprise menstrual blood! I threw on my dress and hurled my body towards the bathroom. I used almost an entire roll of toilet paper and 76 pumps of his super expensive hand soap to wipe down my blood-stained flesh prison.<br><br>

<i>Now what?</i><br><br>

I thought.<br><br>

<i>How the FUCK does one recover from this?</i><br><br>

Now, dear reader, please keep in mind it is 5:30 in the morning. I am exhausted. I am stressed. I am sans tampon. I am sans hope. I am attempting to do the near-impossible job of taming my Vaginal Geyser.<br><br>

Suddenly, I remember that his sheets are white. Stark white. Whiter than the state of Idaho, white.<br><br>

<i>What the literal FUCK is with Brooklyn Bro Boys and their goddamn white sheets?</i><br><br>

Check out this piece of quick wisdom: the easiest way to throw a man off the scent of your crime is through distraction. I had previously mentioned to <strong>The Hot Guy</strong> that I was “on the last day of my period––barely any blood!” He wasn’t perturbed. He said he didn’t care.  This was, however, different. The blood was much more than anticipated.<br><br>

….<br><br>
….<br><br>
….<br><br>

<i>BUT! What...what...if…..</i><br><br>

….<br><br>
….<br><br>
….<br><br>

I became the portrait of absolute mania as I stood in this bathroom with one hand gripping the side of the sink basin, the other hand feverishly rubbed Aesop brand lotion all over my bloody body. My mind raced—<br><br>

<i>BUT! What if, what if!</i><br><br>

….<br><br>
….<br><br>
….<br><br>


<i>What if the overestimation of my menses came coupled with, like, good-to-average intercourse?<br><br>

What if my distraction was, in fact, sex?<br><br>

Is, “WOW you’re literally so great at coitus with your humongous man-dick that you jostled my uterus into having the Second Reckoning of My Period ™?,” a believable explanation for sudden onset explosive blood gush?<br><br>

Perhaps.</i><br><br>
…<br><br>
…<br><br>
…<br><br>

This was the final frontier.<br><br>

We had—The Relations, Part II (THE *rEmIX*).<br><br>

In a night full of surprises, the fact that this dumb plan worked was the biggest of them all. Less of a mistake than I had originally envisioned.<br><br>

But <strong>The Hot Guy</strong> eventually seeing the blood was inevitable of course. <Strong>The Hot Guy</strong> was fake-woke enough to pretend like he really didn’t care. He said it was okay at least 30 times, but kept taking sharp inhales as he removed layer upon layer of bloody sheets.<br><br>

I almost wished all that blood had been from my brutal murder at the hand’s  of <strong>The Hot Guy</strong> just so I wouldn’t have to be alive to bear witness to this moment.<br><br>

He stared at me as I re-dressed and tried to hold back tears. The silence went on for a year and a half until <strong>The Hot Guy</strong> spoke up,<br><br>

“You know it’s like—wait, never mind. I can’t say that.”<br><br>

“WHAT,” I pressed.<br><br>

“WHAT IS IT <i>L I K E.</i>”<br><br>

“I dunno, I was just gonna call it, like, ‘Red Velvet.’  Ha-ha-ha.”<br><br>

“What.”<br><br>

“Like Red Velvet…. Like—hahaha...uh, like my...cum? AhHaHAHaha. And like your blood—together. Hahaha it’s like uh, uh a red velvet cake with frosting? You know,  like a red velvet cake?”<br><br>

…<br><br>
…<br><br>
....<br><br>

Fucking Christ.<br><br>

<div id ="dividers"><strong>EPILOGUE.</strong><br><br></div>
Dear Reader, I think about this absolute fucking nonsense phrase that he said to me <strong>very goddamn frequently.</strong><br><br>

If you thought that this red velvety red flag was enough to assuage from dating this clown for another 4 months, you clearly don’t know how fucked up I am by men’s opinions of me. Luckily, it’s 2019 and I follow at least 5 more intersectional feminist Instagram accounts than I did last year.
<br><br>
But this was all happening in 2018. So I Amazon Prime’d him a gallon of bleach.<br><br>
