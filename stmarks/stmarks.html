  Grappling with the bolt of thunder that was St. Mark’s Place was similar to the blurry
thrill of a first girlfriend. I had matured in every sense of the manner when I begun hanging
around the East Village: I was no longer a feeble, naive freshman, I was generally acclimated
with the vast scope of New York streets, I had found wondrous, diverse friends, and even been in
a relationship or two. Every unchecked box of the urbanite NYU student had now been fulfilled, and I had the fortune of living with two of my closest friends at a cozy, if not dust-ridden and
crumbling, prewar apartment on 4th street between 2nd and 1st Avenues. Being situated in the
core of what was once an unpredictable neighborhood soon transformed into being immersed
within the vibrantly young, and predominantly safe East Village Historic District, selected at the
very least for its reasonable rent price and proximity to the purple empire a few streets over. I’d
sniff and cough as I explored, my innards tickled and tormented by the copious amounts of mites
and detritus a hundred year old building injected into my lungs. Prior to living in the youthful,
colorful neighborhood, St. Mark’s Place had been a pit stop associated with the promise of a
college night out: between the pickings of ill-fated karaoke parlors, the Indian and Bangladeshi
street vendors, tattoo parlors, multifarious bars, a wide selection of open-late eateries including
the sumptuous Khyber Pass and Mamoun’s, St. Mark’s was one of those streets that you’d either
start or end the night with.<br><br>

In the daytime, few other streets, even in a city as disorienting as New York could be,
featured shop-windows which contained stacked, dismembered baby dolls, complete with
gouged eyeballs like those of Search & Destroy’s, or a haphazard collection of mannequins,
memorabilia, and newspaper cutouts strewn all over the floor over at the storefront at Trash &
Vaudeville, a first-stop for punk fashion. If New York is a melting pot of cultures, cuisines and
ethnicities, then St. Mark’s Place is one of the focal points in the heterogeneous cauldron.<br><br>

In the nightlife landscape of a NYU student, this haggard, loud, blaring street flexed its
muscles too conspicuously for anyone to miss. The essence of St. Mark’s Place isn’t just rooted
in the sheer movements that have planted their flag here, but in its inexorable diversity. The most
comprehensive work dedicated to the street is St. Mark’s native Ada Calhoun’s “St. Mark’s Is
Dead: The Many Lives of America’s Hippest Street”. Calhoun, who had spent several years on
the street as a child, dove into the exoskeleton of the fascinating area, highlighting a number of
renowned names that had called St. Mark’s home at one time or the other, including but not
limited to Keith Haring, Abbie Hoffman, Lenny Bruce, members of both The New York Dolls
and the Velvet Underground, and W.H. Auden, who famously would use the lavatory at a nearby
liquor store, as his apartment was so cramped and inhospitable that it didn’t feature a bathroom
To attempt to chronicle every movement, every political faction, every ideologue or art
collective, every immigrant tenement that was set up, every late-night anecdote from the age of
Patti Smith and Led Zeppelin, every poem sung aloud at the Grassroots Tavern, every Jewish vs.
Italian mob skirmish that took place, every hippie, every punk, every Hare Krishna activist, the
trials and tribulations of every famous resident, or every story behind some of the Victorian and
Greek revival architectural styles all merit some other manifestation; each topic deserving of
endless books to capture their beautiful madness.<br><br>

That being said, these bustling, creatively contrarian spirits merge to form a landscape
that doesn’t just welcome change as much as it is wholeheartedly defined by it. MacDougal
street may have been the convivial center of the Beat movement, but St. Mark’s has revelled in a
kaleidoscope of dynamism, constantly evolving; constantly a home for those who are perceived
as outcasts or pariahs. This full-throttle mentality is best summarized by Calhoun:<br><br>

“The street has been rich and poor and rich again. The cycle of wealth and
poverty has spun like a wheel for four hundred years. The street is prosperous now,
featuring comically high rents...But it is insanity to think...that rents will ‘keep going up
forever’-- that a place where change has come so often will never change again... how
ironic a street famed for experimentalism should be home to such prickly nostalgia.”
(Calhoun 9)<br><br>

From the visual and gustatory delights on show, that boundless diversity still very much
seems to be the case. But the perilous, plodding vision of New York that is swallowing up the
environment around it is starting to gently sink its teeth into the hallowed street of musical,
artistic, and historical lore. My conjectural thoughts were confirmed by a wave of news articles
that appeared while conducting research for this very work: a digital graveyard appeared on my
screen, listing storied venues that had joined the annals of mere nostalgia. Sasha Frere-Jones, a
notable music critic for The New Yorker, begins his positive online review of Calhoun’s book by
mentioning that “New York breeds mourners...if you grow up anywhere in the city, there’s a
good chance your childhood memories will be sold to the highest bidder...you won’t be invited to
the memorial, New York runs a red light past sentiment”. With the gusto of an Agatha Christie
murder scene, an anonymous, blood-red painted declaration on the walls of the shuttered Mars
Bar rung out for everyone to see: “The East Village is Dead.” Whether this is true is, of course,
somewhat subjective, but the graveyard adds tombstones to its array several times a year:
“Cherries”, a sex-geared costume shop, shut in November 2011. Further up the street, “Sounds”,
a records store cherished by Frere-Jones, also disappeared, seemingly overnight, in November
2015. “St. Mark’s Bookshop” -- which, as Calhoun points out in page-turning investigation in
The New Yorker was the only independent bookstore left on the street — suffered from plaguing
symptoms of financial dissolvence, and was next on gentrification’s hit-list. As I scanned
through the piece, eager to learn about the collapse of such a staple, I couldn’t resist the notion
that the webpage was reading like a sort of obituary. Calhoun pointed out that, in the days before
the physical closure, regulars, browsers, friends and one-time customers visited the facade of the
Bookshop to “pay their respects” (Calhoun, “What Went Wrong With St. Mark’s Bookshop”),
further propagating the point that this was an elegiac experience. At least, unlike countless other
independent institutions that faced the ghost of Moses’ urbanization guillotine, it had one. As I
scurried across St. Mark’s, eager to make it to class on time, I would almost feel a sense of guilt
at my negligence in walking so quickly across such a revered graveyard of the past.<br><br>

Some age-old favorites have managed to prevail though; their windows are a
magnification of another time, out of place amidst a Target and Starbucks sort of world. The
Gem Spa has a treasure trove of occurrences associated with it, and unlike many other sites, the
gravitas of history doesn’t collide on you. This is an ordinary candy-newsstand shop, where the
cashier keeps an eye on his customers’ antics and fuddled college kids devour pie slices from the
nearby 2 Bros as liquid mozzarella drips onto the floor, much to the cashier’s annoyance. Neatly
arranged confectionary treats jostle each other for a customer’s attention, as does an enormous
wall of up-to-date publications. However, thanks to Jen Carlson, I was able to further apprehend
this place’s identity for something more than an appendix to the riotous street it’s on: The New
York Dolls shot the cover of their self-titled debut LP right outside, Robert Mapplethorpe treated
Patti Smith to one of the store’s famous egg-creams on a date in 1967, Ted Berrigan and Allen
Ginsberg both included “GEM” in their poems, and, perhaps most flabbergastingly of all, “Gem
Spa” is the title of a Basquiat painting . I thanked the cashier and strolled out, an egg-cream’s
tangy, frothy flavor resonating in my mouth. A bittersweet thought intensified: If New York
doesn’t acknowledge niches like the Gem Spa, a pit-stop for punks, hippies, Beatniks, college
students, and a wayside wanderer with enough change to use throughout six decades, then what
will become of this space in a few years’ time? I cross the street and find myself in front of a
boisterous branch of Dallas BBQ, its blinding neon silhouettes of pigs calling for attention. It’s
not difficult to find more of these screaming oppositions in an area as liminal and blurred as the
East Village.<br><br>

Geographically speaking, I was a local, for the time being at least. But the divergence
begun there, as did an internal dialogue which I still wrestle with: These places were fascinating,
integral components of people’s childhoods and experiences. The area that spanned the
legendary Bowery, the spider-like St. Mark’s and the confines of the East Village all the way to
Alphabet City now teemed with muscly fraternity kids and Goyard-bag donning American
princesses, lured by the promise of affordable (but still significantly expensive) rents, a palpable
neighborhood feel, and, it goes without mentioning, New York University just a stone’s throw
away. Its entire internal population had begun to shift away from the disastrously brilliant
denizens who had established St. Mark’s mobile, ingenious status as “America’s Hippest Street”,
as Calhoun’s book title suggests. This phenomenon was eerily similar to the one I explore during
my meal at the erstwhile Bohemian watering-hole turned Michelin Star eatery, Minetta Tavern.
As the epicentre of junior year life, I found it difficult to articulate and unpack my enthusiasm
and awareness of the transient nature of the neighborhood. It’s not that I couldn’t find the words,
or memorize the facts, or that my brain was clouded by a beer or two enjoyed at some dive bar
with friends. In that respect, my age just didn’t fit the profile of a rabid nostalgic. Not only was I
a direct beneficiary of NYU, an outsider by way of my national background, and perhaps a
member of a pattern perceived as a direct cause of the need for more renovations, revamps and
closures, but I was also someone who hadn’t even been to these places I rhapsodize about. They
remained -- or rather, ascended to -- a mythical status.<br><br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/54qyg8K.jpg"><br><br>

Moreover, what shocked me was how recently some of these seismic changes occurred.
I’m not just referring to the closure of many of aforementioned venues, but also the amoebic
manner in which movements and sentiments enjoy their lifespan. One book that underscored this
principle was a work that covered a surprisingly contemporary time period, especially when
juxtaposed to the timeframes meditated on earlier, and in doing so made the phantom New York
I longed to be a part of that much closer. “Meet Me In The Bathroom: Rock and Roll and
Revival In New York City 2001-2011”, by Lizzy Goodman, covers an incredible epoch, wherein
the musical landscape of post-punk and the roots of electronic pop music were beginning to take
full flight. As well as reading about the riotous antics of Interpol, The Strokes, the Yeah Yeah
Yeahs and LCD Soundsystem, there was brilliant, oral-history coverage of a transitory East
Village New York, shedding itself of a coarse, 90s skin and boldly striding into the 21st century,
replete with a pugilistic attitude that remained resilient even in the wake of the September 11th
attacks.<br><br>

The post-punk movement was in itself an attempt to regress to past glory: the punk scene,
which held St. Mark’s Place as its vital organ, had dissipated in popularity as the hair-metal,
more delicate face of the 1980s began. Sonic Youth, Television, New York Dolls, and the
amusingly named Richard Hell and the Voidoids had turned Manhattan venues on their belly
with their relentless, sweaty and unabashed form of music during the 1970s. Mohawks, beer
bottles and cigarette butts, as well as a cornucopia of narcotics, were the order of the day across
downtown New York as The Sex Pistols, led by the notorious Sid Vicious, blasted their brand of
angry nonchalance across the Atlantic from Britain. To the post-punk 90s kids, these bands had
been stuff of legend, plastered on their bedroom walls: somewhere in between Led Zeppelin’s
1975 Physical Graffiti album (which featured a photo of 96 St. Mark’s Place on its cover) and
the grunge of Nirvana in 1991. Punk was a furious, no-holds movement had gone mainstream for
the world, and specifically for New York, to run wild with.<br><br>

One specific venue casts its spectral, grim shadow above all others in the battle for New
York’s soul. Its walls, usually black, are covered unreservedly with stickers, scratched messages,
messy graffiti, incisions, thumb-tacks, Polaroid photographs, mini concert ads, pamphlet pages,
rebellious messages, profanities, rusted nails, peace symbols, skulls, and that’s only a sixteenth
of the location. Every photo on the venue’s website, run and maintained by friends of the owner,
features chaotically designed homogeneity throughout the entire club. It sits under a jet-black
awning at 315 Bowery. Blondie, The Dictators, Talking Heads, Guns N’ Roses, The Strokes, the
Ramones, Murphy’s Law , and many more have graced the beer-soaked, unkempt, downtrodden
stage.<br><br>

It is locked in world music lore as being a site of pilgrimage for rock fans. The only issue
is that it doesn’t exist anymore.<br><br>

CBGB’s legacy is so boldly publicized that it strikes a familiar chord with most New
Yorkers. The club closed in 2006 due to rental debacles and landlord wars, though the Gothic
typeface of the old spot has been emblazoned onto T shirts and various merchandise since. For
some, CBGB’s demise was emblematic of the last light burning out in old New York. “All of
Manhattan lost its soul to money lords,” says Cheetah Chrome, member of The Dead Boys,
CBGB regulars. A “Save CBGB” website still exists on the internet, its simple, early 2000s
HTML format a stark, sorrowful contrast to the club’s zany interiors. John Varvatos, an upscale
fashion brand which sells leather jackets at nearly $2,000 a piece, moved into the vacancy.
According to Moss’s “Vanishing New York”, the eponymous designer requested that the
interiors be kept intact, and that the shop would not carry out any wholesome renovations so as
to maintain the rocking charm of yesteryear. I paid a visit to the once holy site, and microscopic
remnants of the club are visible outside. Yet, another one of Moss’s terms that I’ve found use for
perked itself up again: fauxstalgia. John Varvatos, generally a proprietor of rock-inspired
fashion, seemed to find a way to refine CBGB’s into a marketing tool, offering occasional
concerts and a corny vinyl collection. I’m not an angsty contrarian -- I do believe their efforts
are somewhat genuine. However, these ideas present themselves as somewhat corny and
embarrassingly unaware, though they are not as cringey as the decorated restaurateur Daniel
Boulud opening a brunch spot nearby and naming it “DBGB’s”. That, even to someone like me,
felt like painful sacrilege. A few blocks down, monumental, gorgeous glass structures are erected
by Avalon Communities for residential and office use, bringing trendy new restaurants alongside
them. I know a few NYU students who live there, and they are blissfully unaware of the area
their properties encroach on. It’s not their fault, after all. So who is going to take the blame for
the sneaky annihilation of the East Village; a sentence of death by a thousand cuts and a million
more rent hikes?<br><br>

It’s certainly easy to romanticize the past, and the clambering, I-can-almost-taste-it nature
of the writing I produce certainly implies a sense of idolization. I’d never disregard the plethora
of crime, the stinking odor of unsorted garbage, or the sleazy, prostitute and drug-ridden guise
that New York adopted as austerity hit “Fear City” in the 1970s. That which occurred at St.
Mark’s Place is as crystal a window into that uglier, more dangerous era than any other. That
being said, it’s still an integral part of the megapolis’ identity, and a cog of its machination that
becomes more, not less, important as it grows and subsumes further. The East Village is
representative of the dynamism of a certain spirit; a spirit so embracing and welcoming it is
perhaps the most quintessentially American tenet of the anomaly that is New York. Folks in and
around St. Mark’s have rallied to all sorts of movements; they’ve felt the agony of being the
token pariahs and the ecstasy of the miraculous, bittersweet moments that the clubs and bars of
yesteryear keep behind their shuttered doors safely. St. Mark’s Place is here to see, to smell, to
revel in, to gorge in, to drunkenly slump on, and the sheer connotation that bleeds on that stretch
of land between Avenue A and 3rd Ave will find a way to live forever, but it’s up to our younger
generations to revive that madness, even if it is just to preserve rather than inauthentically
reenact. In 2010, The New York Times decided to serialize a few of Jeremiah Moss’s blog posts
long before he ascended to book fame, selecting to highlight a specific conquest of his. His
multidisciplinary adventure sought to discover whether Edward Hopper’s 1942 masterpiece
“Nighthawks” was situated in a real location (Moss, “Nighthawks State of Mind”), rectifying an
unsolved mystery. Moss and his acolytes rummaged through archives, consulted noted experts and pieced together an investigation like sleuths. However, there was no conclusive evidence,
with Moss admitting that his guess of the diner being located at the corner of Greenwich Avenue
and Mulry Square was hopeful conjecture at best. He ended the piece, mired in defeat, with the
following sentence, a statement so gorgeously universal that it encapsulates the ethereal nature of
this infinite struggle. “It seems the longer you live in New York, the more you love a city that’s
vanished”, he writes. “For those of us well versed in loving what’s lost, it’s an easy leap to
missing something that was never really there.”
