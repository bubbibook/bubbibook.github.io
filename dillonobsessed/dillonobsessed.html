  <div class="title"><strong>THINGS DILLON IS<br>OBSESSED WITH</strong></div><br>
      Old broken-in shoes, finding free books, food trucks - especially Biryani House across from Zuccotti Park, toast and butter, Herman Hesse, full on sprinting, Hide and Seek by Imogen Heap, Pellegrino, getting unexpected texts from people I like but haven’t talked to in a while, not being sure about song lyrics and looking them up and being right, new toothbrushes, new razors, Jeff Buckley, Elliott Smith, art made by people who died young, The Matrix, Keanu Reeves, Philip K. Dick, the whole Wheel of Time series, The Shins, Radiohead, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, flying on airplanes, empty seats next to me on airplanes, when I know that that barf was my last and I can fall asleep now, new toothpaste after fighting for drops for a week, The National, Don DeLillo, stressing about my future, York Peppermint Patties, mint chip ice cream, biting my fingernails, yuge yawns, sneezes where I sort of scream, cumming, peeling old tape off of things, acoustic guitars, Freaks and Geeks, Ireland, olive green, cooking my whole dinner in a frying pan, cast iron skillets, pancakes doused in syrup, great conversations with my mom - especially when I’ve recently been feeling impatient with her, the ocean, getting just a little sunburnt, beach volleyball, pick up soccer, taking turns on my bike with no handlebars, playlists that convey a message, Lord of the Rings, The Sound of Music, Santa Barbara especially during the winter, old churches, eye contact with singers in bands, eye contact with pretty strangers, unearthing mutual insecurities with friends, smoking in the snow, dollar pizza covered in pepper flakes, all Super Smash Bros, professional melee, ping pong, being the only guy in a group of girls, cats, The Count of Monte Cristo, trying on other people’s glasses, Wikipedia rabbit holes, Wikipedia rabbit holes specifically about Jesus and the historicity of the Bible, crosswords, podcasts, debates that border on arguments but don’t quite become arguments, physical contact with friends, decorating my room, buying books, picking my nose, coffee, recently coffee from Cielito Lindo when he foams the milk just a little, breakfast burritos, walking in rhythm with my music, singing in the shower, showing up to a party and knowing people, loud music in cars, driving, fresh hand-me-downs, hearing my parents bitch about my step-brother, thinking of that word I’ve been trying to think of, hearing people talk about things they hate, come-from-behind victories in Settlers of Catan, people who notice that someone has just been talked over who then follow up to ask about what the talked-over person was saying, Google, hearing the crypto has crashed, hopefully one day hearing that crypto is up, fixing computers for people, being asked for advice, feeling gently embarrassed around people I trust, huge farts when my stomach hurts, ranting, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, playing with my beard, getting haircuts, dogs whose faces are so mushed that they’re sort of cross-eyed and make noises when they breath, picking up a violin and still being able to play, having my ears kissed, Thai green curry, arm wrestling, dancing till I’m drenched in sweat, Kyle’s Billy Elliot accent, loyal friends, genuine interest, cumming.
