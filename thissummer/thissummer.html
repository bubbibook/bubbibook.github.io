<italic>I wanted to make them love me and then I wanted to leave forever. <br><br>
I wanted to win them over by saying things like, "What a lovely home you keep. Is this a
Persian rug?" <br><br>

I wanted them to feed me cherries, to cup their boutique-soap-smelling hands underneath
my jaw, eagerly awaiting the pit covered with my saliva. They would say, in unison, "Was that
good? Do you like cherries?" I would shrug. They would feel hurt in a way that they could not
fathom. <br><br>

And then I wanted to disappear for good. 
I wanted them to really wonder about me for the rest of their lives. I would be the biggest
mystery they had ever known. This boring family would be forever changed.</italic>
<br><br>

I don't know why these thoughts are the ones that preoccupy me as I sit at the round
dining table at my boyfriend's childhood home. It's not even a special occasion. Nick just thinks
it’s about time I meet the people who "made him who he is today." He carries himself with an air
of unearned importance. I think my life would be more pleasant if I did this, too.<br><br>

I stab a boiled potato with my fork and feel inexplicably disappointed when it doesn’t
ooze blood. I place it on my tongue, sucking on it a little before I allow my teeth to sink into it. I
think about being a snake, what it would be like to swallow it whole, to be able to open my jaw
wider than the width of my own body. My prey: a fucking boiled potato.<br><br>

"So Alice, what do you do for work?" a woman’s voice – my boyfriend’s mother’s, I
presume – inquires. When I walked through the front door, she kissed me on the cheek and said I could call her by her name, Mary, but I don’t really want to do that. I look up at the strangers I’ve willingly surrounded myself with. They dig their silverware into full, colorful plates, large
smiles pasted on forgettable faces. They are enjoying themselves so aggressively, so intentionally. It makes me want to throw a tantrum like a child.<br><br>

I imagine my boyfriend’s mother waking up early that morning, telling her husband,
“You’d better shave your stubble today. We’re having a guest.” My boyfriend’s father might’ve let out a performative groan in response, lighting up inside like a glowworm thinking, “I am such an important part of the day that is to follow that I have to shave my stubble.”<br><br>

"I don't have a job,” I reply.<br><br>

Nick interjects, "That's not true. She freelances, as a writer." I am not going to fight him on it but I haven't freelanced in two months now. Feels like I am done being a freelancer. He puts his hand on my thigh and looks at me, grinning. He chews on a piece of asparagus slowly. This is the exact moment I lose all attraction towards him. It is, in no way, gradual. Then, he looks into
his plate, cutting a thick piece of carrot in half, and adds, “She’s really good.”<br><br>

"I'm going to use the bathroom," I say, standing up abruptly. My boyfriend's mother looks vaguely upset when I do this. I guess they are not going to love me in the way that I want
them to – in a way that could destroy them all, eventually.<br><br>

The bathroom is so clean that it agitates me. I spit in the bathtub for fun and use someone else's electric toothbrush, then dry it off with a face napkin, which I neatly replace in its small, woven basket so as to look not tampered with. I think about looking in the medicine cabinet but I can’t afford to do cliché things like that when my life is going so poorly. I wonder how, in spite of my general apathy, I have managed to get myself into a relationship with a kind man who tells me he loves me. How I have somehow mustered the audacity to tell people “I am a writer.” How I made the decision to curl my hair this morning.<br><br>


When I return to the dining room, my boyfriend's father says, "You know, Alice,
everyone has a book these days." He doesn’t even wait for me to sit down.
I try not to frown when I respond, "What do you mean?"<br><br>

"Everyone writes books these days. You should just go for it,” his wife answers on his behalf. “Mitchell is actually really good friends with an executive in the publishing industry.”<br><br>

Nick’s father looks in his wife’s direction but not at her and says, “You mean Brandon? We’re not that close.”<br><br>

“Well, I’m sure you could get him on the phone with Alice, at the very least.”<br><br>

“That’s true.”<br><br>

“He could give her some helpful pointers on how to fulfill her writing ambitions.”<br><br>

“Yes, he’s a very smart man. A go-getter type. I’ll see what I can do, Alice,” my
boyfriend’s father smiles at me when he says my name. I smile back but if my smile were a gesture, it would be a shrug. If it were a sound, it would be a sigh.<br><br>

Nick looks at me, with a funny expression that demands forgiveness and gratitude at once. I exhale deeply. The only thing I want to do is lean my back against a large tree and listen
to my audiobook of Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya. My favorite thing about audiobooks of plays is that
a single narrator plays every role, only slightly changing his or her intonation, resonance, or pitch
to distinguish between characters. Recognizing a shift in dialogue, then, makes me feel
especially present, in a palpable way I can never muster in the pockets of my life that actually
matter. I soon realize that my prolonged silence has created an awkward space in time, so I say,<br><br>

“I’ve written a book already.”<br><br>

“Well, that’s just so lovely!” my boyfriend’s mother beams, “Nick, why didn’t you say she’s already written a book?” Her silver tooth gleams in a single, seething ray of sunlight that filters through the adjacent window. The way the light bounces off of it makes it look like it’s dancing. I imagine the silver tooth jumping out of her mouth to perform a choreographed number. We will all applaud at the end of its presentation, not because it was particularly well
done but because it takes an overwhelming amount of courage for a tooth to perform so freely, to make its appetite for dancing so conspicuous. It will give a humble bow and then dutifully climb back into my boyfriend’s mother’s mouth, because it knows it can never be a professional dancer. After all, it’s only a sensible tooth. It knows its place, which is more than I can say for
most people.<br><br>

I take a sip of my water and nod, “Yes, it’s lovely to have written a book.”<br><br>

“Alice, can I talk to you for a second? In private?” Nick says to me. He looks so sincerely upset that I have to stifle a large, bellowing laugh that takes root at the very pit of my stomach. I stand up and he guides me to the front of the house by touching my elbow lightly. I’m not the blind, I think. He doesn’t have to touch my elbow like that.<br><br>

When we have reached the foyer, Nick says, “You aren’t taking this seriously.”<br><br>

I cock my head to the side, “What do you mean?” I know exactly what he means.<br><br>

“You haven’t written a book, Alice. Why are you lying to my family?”<br><br>

I tug on the bottom of my shirt, roll it up in my palm a little. He’s right. I haven’t written a book. I don’t have the patience to do this and I doubt that I ever will. I’ve always thought that patience is something you are born with, like passion. I don’t have passion or patience. The only
thing I have, innately, is pain. Like a lump of why-do-I-exist stuck in my throat at all times. I imagine going to the world’s most experienced surgeon to ask if he can remove my existential tumor. He will laugh at me and send me home with an artificially flavored lollipop. I will die three days later and he will be put behind bars for condescension. This will be the general trajectory of events. The details are fuzzy.<br><br>

“I’m going to take off for a little bit. I don’t feel well,” I decide aloud.<br><br>

“If you leave now,” he stops himself. “Look, I want to be there for you but you make it so hard sometimes. You sabotage yourself. You know this. I love you but I need for you to love yourself.”<br><br>

“That is, just, so much information, Nick.”<br><br>

“What happened isn’t your fault. It’s nobody’s fault,” he reaches for my hand the second time he says the word “fault.” I throw my arm behind my body, instinctively feeling for the front door.<br><br>

“Alice,” he says, taking a step backwards. “Breathe.”<br><br>

I think I am going to cry so I feign a large yawn instead, “I am breathing just fine. I’m just bored.”<br><br>

“You’re leaving because you’re bored?”<br><br>

I don’t mean that, so I blink wildly for some time to distract him.<br><br>

“What am I supposed to tell my parents?” he finally asks.<br><br>

“Tell them I had to take a call. A freelancing thing. When I come back, I’ll be apologetic. But I can’t be sorry right now.”<br><br>

“What are you even gonna do?”<br><br>

I shrug, even though I know exactly what I’m going to do. I’m going to find a tree, curl up at the base of its trunk, and surrender myself to the reassuringly mundane world of Chekhov’s characters. Resigned, Nick opens the front door for me and closes his eyes, like he simply can’t bear to see me make a mess of a perfectly good afternoon. His eyes are still shut when I give him
a perfunctory kiss on the chin, halfway out the door.<br><br>

I stumble past Nick’s hatchback reflecting heat in the driveway, suddenly aware that I don’t even know the make or model. I’ve never been interested in cars, but this would be useful information to keep on file, just in case of a tragedy. Its headlights glisten under the scorching sun. It looks like the hatchback is winking at me, so as to say: “You don’t know me at all.”<br><br>

I walk until their house is out of sight, past several homes that look no different from one another. Modest, pastel things, overlooking small, manicured lawns dotted with delicate flowers sulking in the humidity. I walk for fifteen minutes, probably, but I am still flanked by these stupid houses. It feels like I could walk for the rest of my life and the string of houses would never end. It occurs to me that I should’ve taken Nick’s hatchback. Even though I wouldn’t
know where to drive it, I’d have access to an air conditioner. I’m suddenly aware of a dryness spreading across the back of my throat, recalling the sound of a plastic water bottle rolling up and down in the tight space of the glove compartment.<br><br>

This year, we effectively skipped spring and summer announced itself suddenly, hot and ready from the day it started. As when it began, its dry tongue seems to stretch for miles and miles around the earth again and again. This summer is the kind of summer that makes winter feel like a dystopian myth. Like if you turned on the television to a scene of glaciers melting on National Geographic, you might think about how far CGI has come.<br><br>

So this large tree is not only crucial to the overarching vision of my desire, but also logistically, as I would require substantial shade to listen to my audiobook without collapsing of a heatstroke. Soon, I realize that I’ve been trudging along for nearly half an hour, and that I haven’t encountered a single person or tree during my trek. For all I know, I could be walking in a loop. I turn around in a circle, like a dog chasing its tail. I am panting, like a dog chasing its tail. All I see is shrubbery, which I decide has got to be the dumbest thing in the world. I begin to feel dizzy, as the heat waves that shroud my path grow more pronounced, threatening to manifest into steel hurdles.<br><br>

I am about to give up and turn around when I see, not too far in the distance, the perfect tree. Its abrupt appearance is magical almost, like I have silently willed it into existence. I am transfixed, not simply because this tree emerged in my field of vision so suddenly, but because it is identical to the tree that I had in mind, that I so carefully imagined. I wouldn’t even say that it bears a striking resemblance. No, this is the tree that my subconscious was longing for and, in this way, I have conjured it out of thin air.<br><br>

Before I know it, I am running towards this tree with a kind of athleticism I never knew I harbored. My form mimics that of an experienced runner. In confident strides, my arms moving in faultless tandem with my legs, my body propels itself forward. A heavy, sticky breeze created by my own movement offers minimal relief. As I steadily approach the tree, it grows even more surreal and, before I know it, I am standing in its generous shade. I run my index finger along the curiously soft bark, realizing that this is at once a completely ordinary yet exceptional tree. And somehow, it is even more perfect than I anticipated. It occurs to me that I am smiling wildly, when a languid voice interrupts my hilarity: “Excuse me?”<br><br>

I throw my head back to find a boy standing in the driveway. I can’t help but suck in my breath when I look at him, looking at me. It all makes sense. This summer. This tree. This boy. I am so completely in awe of this day. In this moment, I am certain that my life’s purpose has always been, will always be, to experience this one, single day in time.<br><br>

I allow my eyes to drink in the image of this beautiful, lanky boy, whose appearance is so hauntingly familiar that looking at him reminds me of the first time I saw an x-ray of my own head as a child. The doctor pointed to a deep black recess in the very center of my face, confirming that my sinuses were indeed blocked. I looked at my father, who was sitting next to me, and pleaded: “This is not me.” Sternly, he replied, “That’s right. It’s only your skull.” The memory gives me shudders to this day. Still, I am ravenous to see all of this boy. I want him to twirl for me. I want him to prove that he is three-dimensional. But he remains firmly planted, his silhouette glowing against the red sunlight.<br><br>

Violent, black curls fall into his dark eyes, stopping just above the high bridge of his nose. His pale, smooth face mimics the cold resilience of a stone sculpture. His gangly physique is only accentuated by the baggy clothes he wears. A grey t-shirt hangs over angular shoulders. Loose fitting shorts reveal two sickly calves. He leans against the car in the driveway (again, I couldn’t say what kind) so confidently, his hand fixed on the metal hood, which I can only imagine would be as hot as a stovetop on a day like this. I am briefly convinced that he is an angel, or at the very least a figment of my imagination, until he recoils his hand, shaking it in front of his body in pain – up and down, back and forth: “Fuck!”<br><br>

“Are you alright?” I start towards him.<br><br>

“I’ll be fine,” he replies, deepening his voice, clearly embarrassed. He shoves his hand into his pocket and looks up at me, expectantly.<br><br>

“Is this your tree?” is all I can manage.<br><br>

“I suppose so, yes. Since this is my house,” he replies, stealing a quick look at the house behind him, like he is making sure it’s still there.<br><br>

“Who are you?” I cannot help myself.<br><br>

“This is my house,” he repeats. “Who are <italic>you</italic>?”<br><br>

“I’m just looking for shade,” I say, like that’s my name. Just-looking-for-shade. Pathetic.<br><br>

He offers a warm smile. The way his top lip curls is reminiscent of a lighter’s last spark.<br><br>

“Nice to meet you, just-looking-for-shade,” the boy says, before adding, “I’m off then.”<br><br>

“Is that ok?” I blurt out, desperate for him to stay.<br><br>

The boy has clearly already made up his mind that this is okay, but he pretends to think for some time – it seems, for my sake. “Well, I feel no real ownership towards this tree. And my parents are out of town. So, yeah, feel free.”<br><br>

He gets into the driver’s seat, closing the door behind him, and turns the key in the ignition. The engine rumbles and I am overwhelmed with panic. Without any deliberation, I approach the car and knock on his window with a clammy fist. He rolls it down and squints at me, “Yes?”<br><br>

“Where are you going?”<br><br>

“Why?”<br><br>

“Could I join you?”<br><br>

The boy hesitates before repeating his question, “Why?”<br><br>

“It’s really hot out. I’m not from here and I’ve walked a long way from my car,” I say, as though this is sufficient reason.<br><br>

“Why?” he asks, for a third time. Now I want to smack him on the head, but I don’t know him like that.<br><br>

“I’m neurotic, I guess,” I try.<br><br>

“I feel that,” the boy says, good-naturedly. Then, he scowls at the sky and looks me square in the face, “To tell you the truth, I’m conflicted. You’re being a little creepy, but I could also use the company. Would you let me think about it for a minute?”<br><br>

I nod, reckoning that his transparency is refreshing until he reclines his seat, and shuts his eyes like he is going to take a nap. Now he’s just being weird and rude. I dismiss these thoughts when I realize he could certainly say the same things about me. Waiting patiently under the sun’s wrath, I am suddenly baffled by my lack of humiliation. I can’t say whether it’s the familiarity I
feel towards the boy, the vertiginous heat, or a combination of the two that has allowed me to forge this version of myself that has no sense of ego. Too quickly, I realize it’s neither of these things. It’s grief.<br><br>

“Hello?” I hear the boy say. I turn back to the car to see his head poking out of the window, inquisitively. His expression is so alert that it briefly inspires me to forgo sleep for the remainder of my life. “You can join if you’d like. But you should know that I have a girlfriend.”<br><br>

When he says this, I feel the compulsion to laugh and weep in equal amounts. I am about to shake my head when I realize that I am already shaking my head, that I have perhaps been doing so for my entire interaction with the boy. “I’m not interested in younger guys,” I assure him. “And, truthfully, you remind me of someone I know very platonically.”<br><br>

When we are both buckled into burning, leather seats, he turns to me, “We’re going to a bar.”<br><br>

Soon, we’re speeding down the winding, suburban street. Speeding is perhaps the wrong word. We’re traveling at a moderate pace, but this day feels like it’s unfolding one step ahead of me, too quickly – like everything is happening in fast forward.<br><br>

“My name is Jules, by the way,” the boy says. Jules.<br><br>

“Like Julian?” I ask.<br><br>

“Yes, like Julian,” Jules replies.<br><br>

“I’m Alice.”<br><br>

<div class="text">
“This bridge takes us into town, Alice,” Jules says, turning left onto a wide bridge. Steam rises from the concrete before us, which is sparsely populated with a few other vehicles. It occurs to me that this is really happening. There are real, other people on the road. Jules adds, “I’m only trying to have one beer to cool off, so don’t worry. I’ll be okay to drive us back.”<br><br>

Within the next five minutes, we arrive at the bar, which looks like a large sauna from the outside – a grand, wooden cube. The entrance door itself is made entirely of wood, with a small, circular window carved into the top half. Jules pulls open the wooden door and gestures for me to walk in first.<br><br>

The interior of the bar mirrors that of an ordinary sports bar. The television displays that hang in every corner, however, are switched off – dark and silent. I imagine the displays coming alive at four in the morning – wired, nocturnal things – flipping between various channels that are secretly tapings of real dreams that real people are having in real time. The only sounds that permeate the space are the obnoxious hum of the central air conditioner, and the exhausted conversations of heat-stricken, midday bar hoppers. I see an old woman clothed in a skimpy, floral dress glugging down a dark beer like her life depends on it. Jules turns to me to say, “She’s a regular.” When he says this, I am assuming he is a regular too.<br><br>

The two of us sit opposite one another in a tight booth near the door. When a middle-aged
man shows to take our order, Jules looks at me.<br><br>

“I’ll have a basket of fries,” I say. This is something I decided much earlier, when Jules
first announced that we were going to a bar.<br><br>

The middle-aged man half-coughs-half-chuckles, “A basket?”<br><br>

“Or whatever you serve fries in, I guess.”<br><br>

The middle-aged man thinks and then says, sincerely, “It’s more like a tall, cylindrical
cup.”<br><br>

“That’ll be fine,” I say.<br><br>

“It’s fairly wide, too,” he adds.<br><br>

“That’s great,” I acknowledge.<br><br>

“I’ll have a pint of the usual,” Jules says.<br><br>

The middle-aged man gives each of us a quick nod and then disappears behind the
counter, into the kitchen.<br><br>

“You know, most people just ask for fries,” Jules says.<br><br>

“What?”<br><br>

“They don’t say – ‘a basket of fries’ or ‘a cup of fries.’ They just say fries, and trust that
they’ll be served in an appropriate vessel.”<br><br>

I smile, “But fries are tastier when you eat them out of a basket. Especially if it’s a red
basket. Did you know that the color red makes you hungry?”<br><br>

“Yeah, I did know actually. I have definitely read that somewhere,” Jules replies, a little
smug.<br><br>

“Red. The hungriest color,” I murmur awkwardly, for no reason. He smiles wide, and I
get a kick out of it, until I realize that the bottom row of his teeth is different than I’d expected.
It’s perfectly aligned – not a single tooth protrudes at an odd angle. He grows two, deep dimples
when he smiles as well.<br><br>

I trace his face with my eyes, carefully, to find another inconsistency – a large mole
where his rounded jaw meets his thick earlobe. His long nose lacks the punctuation of a subtle
hook. The texture of his skin, under the shadowy bar lights, is no longer smooth, but fairly
blemished. Shallow craters wander across both of his cheeks. A soft, troubled pink sprawls the
width of his forehead. I shift my gaze to the wooden table, where Jules rests his hands, one on
top of the other – slender, delicate things that look like they should belong to a woman. Our
proximity has shattered a crucial illusion, and I am suddenly overwhelmed by my stupidity. I’ve
not only made a fool of myself in front of this stranger, but I’ve also imposed myself on him.<br><br>

The two of us sit in silence until the middle-aged man returns with our orders, and two
glasses of water. He sets them down in front of us quietly, as though observing our silence out of
respect. I push the cup of fries – which, as promised, is tall and wide – to the center of the table,
“I’m never going to be able to finish these myself.” Happily following orders, Jules takes a fry
and throws it into his mouth. He washes it down with a long sip of beer while I devour my glass
of water in impolite mouthfuls, recalling my parched throat.<br><br>

“Nothing like a beer on a hot day like this,” Jules says, sheepishly. There is small dollop
of froth, vaguely shaped like a comma, tucked in his philtrum. It evaporates quickly, before he
can add, “I hope I’m not offending you by drinking?”<br><br>

“Not at all,” I say, motioning towards his full glass, “Please.”<br><br>

“Just making sure you’re not a recovering alcoholic or anything like that. Are you?” The
way he asks makes it sound like he hopes it’s true.<br><br>

“Not recovering. Just an alcoholic,” I smile. I don’t think Jules gets the joke because
shifts uncomfortably in his seat and takes another big drink before slouching his body against the
window. Now I am not sure I get the joke either. “I’m just taking a break from drinking. It’s only
been a little over a month.”<br><br>

“Why? Did you used to drink a lot?”<br><br>

“Not a lot. Just for the wrong reasons.”<br><br>

“Does anyone drink for a good reason,” Jules remarks, readjusting his posture to sit
firmly upright. I realize that he was pressing himself up the metal frame of the window quite
forcefully. Pink, pressure lines decorate the side of his right arm like apathetic tattoos. “So, who
do I remind you of?”<br><br>

“No one, actually” I say. And this is the full truth. Jules reminds me of no one.<br><br>

He raises his eyebrows, “Now that you’ve taken a good look at me?”<br><br>

I nod with certainty.<br><br>

“I somehow manage to disappoint people I barely know all the time.” His tone is
mechanical, like this is a fact he has learned by rote. Then, he takes a smaller, measured sip,
keeping the rim of the glass directly underneath his lower lip.<br><br>

“No,” I object, forcefully. He lifts his head to look at me, and now we are both staring at
one another. His blank eyes reflect the pools of vacancy in mine, and vice versa. It is like we are
two translucent bugs, pathetic and bare, looking inside each other, trying to pinpoint the other’s
internal organs that take the form of darkened shapes. Our gaze, however, is strengthened by this
mutual emptiness, which seems to suspend time as we patiently wait for the words that I am
going to follow with. I desperately want to tell him that I have never been able to console
anyone, but I decide that I must say something else, anything else. “It has nothing to do with
you.”<br><br>

Again, as though this is a patent truth, Jules recites: “The things that have nothing to do
with you, have everything to do with you.” He exhales sharply and I feel a deep rustling within
my chest. I know what he means all too well, but there is something about this boy – this new
adult – uttering a thought so poignant that makes it extremely humorous.<br><br>

“Catch,” I say, holding a fry in the air, diagonally, ready for take off. Easily distracted,
Jules immediately opens his mouth and tilts his head to follow the fry as it leaps into the air. He
catches it like a frog, his pink tongue wrapping around its yellow crunch. The moment is so
comical, so out of touch with reality, that I feel like I am in a cartoon. Chomping down on the
fry, Jules flashes a grand, perfect smile. The creases that form at the sides of his eyes are so
sweet that they make my mouth taste like honey. And just like that, I’m giddy again. “My turn.”<br><br>

Cheerfully, Jules indulges me, throwing a fry into my open mouth, like he is shooting a
basket. He doesn’t even make it a little difficult and I’m thankful for this. When our brief
laughter subsides, Jules takes a big gulp of his beer, swallowing almost a third of the pint glass.<br><br>

“How old are you?”<br><br>

“Twenty-nine,” I say.<br><br>

“I’m twenty-two,” he says.<br><br>

“Great age.”<br><br>

“Is it?”<br><br>

I nod. Probably is. Probably isn’t. Jules sways his curly head from side to side for some
time before I realize that he is trying to move to the imperceptible rhythm of the chatter that
clutters different corners of this wooden, boxy bar. His attempt is tipsy and endearing, but
ultimately fruitless. When he stops moving, he whispers to me, a little impulsively, “If you don’t
mind, I’d like to share a thought with you.”<br><br>

“Of course.”<br><br>

“It’s something I’ve pondered for some time now,” he prefaces. “I’ve been meaning to
share it with someone older, someone wiser. I’d like to know if it’s really stupid. You’ll tell me
if it’s stupid, right?”<br><br>

I want to tell Jules that I’m hardly older, hardly wiser, but the way he searches my face
for approval fights against my instincts, “Promise.”<br><br>

Jules smiles, gratefully, before downing the rest of his beer, as though pledging
allegiance to the sacred thought that is to follow. I am on the edge of my seat when he begins:<br><br>

“I’ve been doing some thinking about the people we become. For no reason other than
the fact that it’s summer, a season that always makes me nostalgic, and I’ve just finished college.
I don’t have a job yet. I’ve been drinking more than I’d like to as well, to pass the time.” He
clears his throat. Then, simply, “I’ve realized that we end up becoming the people we could
never be, for different people.”<br><br>

I’m not sure I understand yet, as the argument stands, but I don’t want to break his
delicate train of thought, so I keep my head low, listening. He continues carefully, “All the
people in our lives, whom we don’t form lasting ties with, for whatever reason – a failed
relationship, distance, death even – serve, then, to teach us, first and foremost, about our voids.
To highlight the things that we are lacking without them. When these people disappear – again,
for whatever reason – the empty space they create, the things they take with them, feel more
prominent than the things they leave behind. This is just human nature. Does that make sense?”<br><br>

I wrap my hands around my body, “It does.”<br><br>

“And the people we become, then, are exactly the people we were never meant to be. We
are, at best, a culmination of the things that make us empty. We are empty containers, filled with
more emptiness, and this is our substance. Do you follow?”<br><br>

“Yes.”<br><br>

“If this is true, then how are we ever supposed to find happiness within ourselves?”
His words hang in the air. The emptiness he speaks of is so tangible, it’s almost as if a
third person has pulled up a chair beside us. We remain silent. We give this emptiness room to
breathe, to air itself like a fine wine. We allow it to seduce us, to undress us fully, to kiss us in
ways that could only be described as embarrassing. We don’t even sigh when it crushes into our
bones a little.<br><br>

In this moment, all I want to do is pluck Jules’ head off of his body, and for this to feel
exactly like plucking a ripe tomato off of a vine. I want to hear a little pop. Then, I want to bite
into this Jules-tomato, to have red juice dribble down my chin in an affected trail. This would be
my way of saying: “You have unraveled me.”<br><br>

But when I look up at Jules, I realize that this day has never been about me. He stares
past me, intently, his mouth ajar, like a half-open drawer. This day, I understand now, belongs to
him – entirely. “Is this a stupid way to think?” he asks, finally, without breaking eye contact with
the space behind my head.<br><br>

I force myself to smile in a way that is foreign to me. This smile is deep and large. This
smile transforms my heart into a metal box filled with loose beads. And then I lie to him:
“I felt that way a lot when I was your age. And I can tell you for a fact that it is so
stupid.”<br><br>

A sincere sigh of relief escapes him like a sudden gust of wind: “Thank God.”<br><br>

The drive back is happy and quiet. Jules and I share two menthol cigarettes between the
two of us without exchanging a word. They are his cigarettes, so he lights them – one after
another – offering me regular drags by extending his thin arm across my face. Since he is
driving, I take the responsibility of tapping it outside the window every now and again. The only
time he speaks is to say: “So, where am I taking you?” I ask him to drive a handful of blocks past
his tree. I will recognize the house when I see it.<br><br>

When we stop in front of Nick’s childhood home, I turn in my seat to get one last look at
Jules and he does the same. Looking at him now, I feel certain of two things. The first is that I
will always remember him. The second is that I have no real compulsion to keep knowing him. I
know he feels the same when all he says is: “Really good meeting you, Alice.”<br><br>

I step out of the car and cannot help but run towards the house with a kind of juvenile
excitement. I feel like a child who has just learned the alphabet or how to read time. The front
door is unlocked so I let myself in. The first sound I hear is running water in the kitchen followed
by the distinct clatter of cheap porcelain. A loud crash at the bottom of the sink. Then, a
conversation.<br><br>

“Gently, Nick.”<br><br>

“Sorry.”<br><br>

Silence.<br><br>

“Were they close?”<br><br>

“Not really. I think that’s what she regrets the most.”<br><br>

More silence.<br><br>

“Did he at least leave a note?”<br><br>

“No.”<br><br>

“How did he do it?”<br><br>

“I never found a good time to ask.”<br><br>

The faucet stops running.<br><br>

“My God, Nick.”<br><br>

“I know.”<br><br>

“I can’t even begin to imagine what her parents are going through. To lose a child like
that, to lose a sibling like that, it’s just –”<br><br>

The longest silence.<br><br>

“You’ve really got to be there for her. Make her know she’s real loved.”<br><br>

“I’m trying.”<br><br>

The sound of running water, again.<br><br>

I wander into the empty dining room. A purple dishrag sits at the corner of the table.
Without much thought, I take it in my hand and begin to wipe down the glass top. I move the
wet piece of cloth in curved lines for some time, mindlessly. I realize I’ve covered the surface
area of the table three times over when I finally catch my reflection in it. I am confused by my
own expression – eyebrows furrowed, lips turned upwards in a vague smile. I don’t understand
it, but it’s different. And I am surprised to find that the only words reverberating in my head are:<br><br>
<italic>Make her know she’s really loved.</italic>
